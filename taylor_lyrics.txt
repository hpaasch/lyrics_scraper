You were what I wanted when I wanted what I just couldn't have
You were country lovin' really somethin' for three months and a halfEverybody said that you were bad news
but baby I was betting on youSo I guess I owe my friends ten dollars and a six pack
Got myself a big country serving to pay back
Now I'm gonna have to listen to my mumma's "I told you so"
But you weren't even worth all that, ten dollars and a six packI said let them say we're crazy, you said let's go fishing a lot
The midnight moon was blazing baby, I was gazing into your eyesEverything changed when you took me to town
Caught you staring every other girl downSo I guess I owe my friends ten dollars and a six pack
Got myself a big country serving to pay back
Now I'm gonna have to listen to my mumma's "I told you so"
But you weren't even worth all that, ten dollars and a six packCan't believe the time you lost me
Can't believe what it cost meCause I owe my friends ten dollars and a six pack
Got myself a big ol serving to pay back
I had to listen to my mumma's "I told you so"
You ain't never been through that
You ain't worth all that, ten dollars and a six pack
You ain't worth all that, ten dollars and a six pack

7 years and 50 days, the time is passing by
Nothing in this world can be as nice as you and I
And how could we break up like this?
And how could we be wrong?
So many years, so many days and I still sing my songNow I run to you like I always do
When I close my eyes I think of you
Such a lonely girl
Such a lonely world
When I close my eyes I dreamI return to you like I always do
When I close my eyes I think of you
Such a lonely girl
Such a lonely world
When I close my eyes I dream Of you7 years and 50 days, now just look at me
Am I the girl I use to be
So damn what do you see?
And how could we break up like this?
And how could we be wrong?
So many years, so many days and I still sing my songNow I run to you like I always do
When I close my eyes I think of you
Such a lonely girl
Such a lonely world
When I close my eyes I dreamI return to you like I always do
When I close my eyes I think of you
Such a lonely girl
Such a lonely world
When I close my eyes I dream Of you 
You said you were smarter i said just look at my report card you said you know more i said u know less then a door that's when i get to say I'm an 8th grade graduate your a 6th grade idiot don't you wish you were an 8th graduate! 
one, two, three, four,
Before I know it, I'm out the door
Five, six, seven, eight,
Oh, why, didn't I, wait?
Nine and ten,
I sure do regret, then
Chorus:
Oh wait!
For another chance
You need,
To take a risk
So hey,
Just wait! Before it is too late,
Just take, a chance
So tell, me why,
It takes me time,
To wonder how,
How I got this far
But why, didn't I wait?
There was a chance, I needed to take!
Chorus:
Oh wait!
For another chance,
you need,
to take a little risk
So hey!
Just wait! Before it's too late
Just take, a chance
Bridge:
So imagine, what it would be like,
If we never took risks,
or we never had a chance
to
live
La la la la, la la la la la la, la la la la, la la la la ohh oh
Chorus:
Oh wait!
For another chance
You need,
To take a risk
So hey,
Just wait! Before it is too late,
Just take, a chance
Ohh oh 
Nick: Yeah!!!Miley: Woah!!I know this isn't what I wanted
I never thought it'd come this far
Just thinking back to where we started
and how we lost all that we areNick: We were young and times were easy
But I could see it's not the same
I'm standing here but you don't see me
I'd give it all for that to change
And I don't want to lose her
I don't wanna let her goBoth: Standing out in the rain
Need to know if it's over
'cause I will leave you alone
Flooded with all this pain,
Knowing that i'll never hold her,
Like I did before the stormMiley: Before the stormNick: With every strike of lightning
Miley: Comes a memory that lasts
Both: Not a word is left unspoken,
as the thunder starts to crashMiley: Maybe I should give up
Miley & Nick: I'm standing out in the rain,
I need to know if its over,
cause I will leave you alone.
Flooded with all this pain,
Knowing that i'll never hold her,
Like I did before the stormMiley: Trying to keep the light from going inNick & Miley: And the clouds from ripping out my broken heart.
We always say a heart is not whole without the one,
who gets you through the storm.Standing out in the rain, knowing that it's really over
Please don't leave me alone, flooded with all this pain,
knowing that i'll never hold you, like I did before the stormMiley: yeahNick & Miley: Like a did before the storm 
I wish I was strong enough to lift not one but both of us
Some day I will be strong enough to lift not one but both of usEver thought about losing it
When your money's all gone and you lose your whip
You might lose your grip when the landlord tell ya that you're due for rent
And the grass so green on the other side
Make a n**** wanna run straight through the fence
Open up the fridge bout twenty times
But still can't find no food in it
That's foolishness
And sometimes I wonder, why we care so much about the way we look
And the way we talk and the way we act
And the clothes we bought, how much that cost?
Does it even really matter?
'Cause if life is an uphill battle
We all tryna climb with the same ol' ladder
In the same boat, with the same ol' paddle
Why so shallow? I'm just asking
What's the pattern for the madness
Everybody ain't a number one draft pick
Most of us ain't Hollywood actors
But if it's all for one, and one for all
Then maybe one day, we all can ball
Do it one time for the underdogs
Sincerely yours, from one of y'allI wish I was strong enough to lift not one but both of us
Some day I will be strong enough to lift not one but both of usI can feel your pain, I can feel your struggle
You just wanna live, been everything so low
That you could drown in a puddle
That's why I gotta hold us up, yeah hold us up
For all the times no one's ever spoke for us
To every single time that they play this song
You can say that that's what Bobby Ray wrote for us
When the tides get too high
And the sea up underneath get so deep
And you feel like you're just another person
Getting lost in the crowd, way up high in the nosebleed
Uh, because we won't be near yet, both of us
But we still stand tall with our shoulders up
And even though we always against the odds
These are the things that have molded us
And if life hadn't chosen us
Sometimes I wonder where I would've wound up
'Cause if it was up to me, I'd make a new blueprint
Then build it from the ground up, hey
But if it's all for one, and one for all
Then maybe one day, we all can ball
Do it one time for the underdogs
From Bobby Ray, to all of y'all 
So many bunnies on the floor tonight
Hoping and shaking their bunny hips
There's a she bunny in all of us
Ohhhhh!!
Jump on the dance floor don't be shy
Wear pant suits and send a fax
Bunny girls hop on your bunny boys
Ohhhhh whooo!!! 
Well, I saw the things you were doing at the VMAs
And when I got that video award, you took the mic away
Now, I'll try to call security with every step I take
And nothing will even stop with all the music that I ever makeDon't think you're gonna win this time
'Cause you better believe that you're not what you do
I'll get ya! (yeah)
I'll get ya! (yeah)
And when I do, Kanye you'll be bustedI don't wanna be mean to you
But you better believe me when I tell you that
You are never what you do
You're busted. (Busted!)
Yeah, everybody makes mistakes
But, this is how it's gonna be until you apologize on the VMAs
You're busted! 
Any day now
They're talking war
I can see the light that's in your eyes
They're not talkin
A week or two
Oh daddy can I go with you
Oh daddy can I go with youYou pack a suitcase
And take a picture from the wall
I always knew this time would come
When I ask how long
You think you're gonna be
You say "Eh, this crazy world's come undone"Summer's over
And leaves begin to fall
And another winter's on the way
I knew I wasn't gonna take this very well
But I'd give everything to have you here todayEveryday now
They're talking war
I know this time has been
Like its never been before
We're not talking
About a week or two
Oh daddy can I go with you
Oh daddy can I go with you
Oh daddy can I go with you 
Daddy,
I want you to know
How my heart aches with your loss
First your Father
Now your Mother
Lifes most precious treasure
Parents
Though they are no longer
With you on this earth
They will forever
Live in the hearts
Of all who loved themI may not be right next to you
To tell you how much I love you
I may not be right next to you
To give you a Hug of comfort
Distance is a factor in our relationship
But you are in my thoughts
Everyday, from the moment I wake up
You are in my thoughts
You are in my heart
And you are in my prayersI can never replace
The loss of my beloved grandparents
But as your Daughter
I will always be here for you
I am but a phone call away
And if you close your eyes and think of me
Daddy Im right beside you 
This melody is what your love means to me
I love you so much babe can't you see
it is like a rainbow after the thunderstorm
your love aways kept me safe and warm,You had to walk through that open door
I suddenly fell down to the floor
it hurt so much to live without you
I tried not to think about youYou were more than I ever had
my love for you still makes me glad
So please come back we could start anew
no more sitting around feeling blueSo come on, it wil be just me and you
Don't hesitate
It would be great
it's not too late
lets celebrate!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
 
She walks to school
With her arms crossed
It's just another day
At 10 o'clock she hears their screaming
Then finally she sees them
It's scary how things change
And I saw the story on the news
I saw the footage from the roof
I sat down and criedDidn't she call you
Didn't she need you bad enough
Was there some reason
I'm not aware of
Did you not write it down
Just one more thing to do
Where were you
And didn't she pray tooHe kissed his wife goodbye
And took the earliest flight
So he could be home that night
To put his kids to sleep
Down the aisle
Three men walked and said
We're here to die for our God
He stood up and said that's funny
Cause my God died for me
I put the magazine down
I read his words out loud
I sat down and criedDidn't he call you
Didn't he need you bad enough
Was there some reason I'm not aware of
Did you not write it down
Just one more thing to do
Where were you
And didn't he pray tooThe taxis pulled up
On the very day of
The rode 100 floors up
Just to come back down
They never thought they'd see the day
The the towered be up in flames
There was nothing left to say
When it all came downAnd didn't they call you
Didn't they need you bad enough
Was there some reason
I'm not aware of
Did you not write it down
Just one more thing to do
Where were you
Where were you
And didn't they pray ohI walk to school
And I wear a cross
I'm counting
Every day 
You say you want to wait to get married,
why you in a pause,
you say its not your time yet,
when is the perfect time for youjust let me go, tell me im not the one for you

but dont tell me you want to when i dont want to anymorewhat changed your mind in two days

on our future,

tell me i wasnt good enough for you
but dont tell me you want to when i dont want to anymoreit was perfectly set how it would go down

here lies the dreams of a fallen futures,just let me go, tell me im not the one for you
tell me you found someone else in your life
tell me i wasnt good enough for you
but dont tell me you want to when i dont want to anymorewhy did yo do this

tears falling down my eyes with humiliation,

Broadway's Electric Barnyard
I sing a song called Tim McGraw
Request it and they'll play it all day long
I sing in stations all day long
But there's nothin like when you're on
The Electric Barnyard??? from a trailer park in St. Louis
Growin' up not wearin' any shoes
Prettiest hillbilly girl you see all day
Growin' up the other trailer park girls
Couldn't hide their jealousy
Cuz she had the only phone for miles
Now she uses it as a DJSo you should turn ?? 93 on

Everybody's waiting
Everybody's watching
Even when you're sleeping
Keep your ey-eyes openThe tricky thing
Is yesterday we were just children
Playing soldiers just pretending
Dreaming dreams with happy endings
In backyards, winning battles with our wooden swords
But now we've stepped into a cruel world
Where everybody stands and keeps scoreKeep your eyes openEverybody's waiting for you to breakdown
Everybody's watching to see the fallout
Even when you're sleeping, sleeping
Keep your ey-eyes open
Keep your ey-eyes open
Keep your ey-eyes openSo here you are, two steps ahead and staying on guard
Every lesson forms a new scar
They never thought you'd make it this far
But turn around (turn around), oh they've surrounded you
It's a showdown (showdown) and nobody comes to save you now
But you've got something they don't
Yeah you've got something they don't
You've just gotta keep your eyes openEverybody's waiting for you to breakdown
Everybody's watching to see the fallout
Even when you're sleeping, sleeping
Keep your ey-eyes open
Keep your ey-eyes open
Keep your ey-eyesKeep your feet ready
Heartbeat steady
Keep your eyes open
Keep your aim locked
The night goes dark
Keep your eyes open (keep your eyes open)(Keep your ey-eyes open)
(Keep your ey-eyes open)
(Keep your ey-eyes open)Everybody's waiting for you to breakdown
Everybody's watching to see the fallout
Even when you're sleeping, sleepingKeep your ey-eyes open
Keep your ey-eyes open
Keep your ey-eyes open
Keep your ey-eyes open
Keep your ey-eyes open 
You say you've turned it off
Hid your heart up on a shelf
Scared of what it might cost
To take it off for someone else
'Cause lovin him you lost
Too much of yourself
Baby can't you see that he's not me and...I need you to know you can fall into me
That my arms are wide open
And will always be
Right here waiting, staying strong
Come and fall into meI'll follow any road anywhere to get to you
I'll open up my soul
If that's what you need me to do
But now baby it's your move
All you've got to do
Is believe in love, just believe in us now...I need you to know you can fall into me
That my arms are wide open
And will always be
Right here waiting, staying strong
Come and fall into meJust believe in love
Just believe in us
Baby....I need you to know you can fall into me
That my arms are wide open
And will always be
Right here waiting, staying strong
Come and fall into meCome and fall into me
Baby fall into me 
Someone struck a match against the night,
All I could see was you and I.
I was captivated.
A perfect little dream inside my head,
And then reality crept in, and erased it.For a while I thought that I could hold you,
But you were just a temporary high.Firefly you drew me to you,
Your beauty shines and lights up the sky
And you don't know it, do you?
I wish I could keep you, firefly
FireflySomething so beautiful and free,
Was as never meant to be caged in
I thought I had you in my hand,
I tried to catch you, but I can't
Chase the windAnd just as I reach out to touch you,
I remind myself you were meant to fly.Firefly you drew me to you,
Your beauty shines and lights up the sky
And you don't know it, do you?
I wish I could keep you firefly
FireflyI like to think I'd be all that you wanted
Not even that is enoughFirefly you drew me to you
Your beauty shines and lights up the sky
And you don't know it do you?
I wish I could keep you
I wish I could keep you, firefly
Firefly 
The actual name of the song is "You're still Innocent", debuted on MTV Video awards on September 12th, 2010I guess you really did it this time
Left yourself in your warpath
Lost your balance on a tightrope
Lost your mind tryin' to get it backWasn't it easier in your lunchbox days?
Always a bigger bed to crawl into
Wasn't it beautiful when you believed in everything?
And everybody believed in you?It's all right, just wait and see
Your string of lights is still bright to me
Oh, who you are is not where you've been
You're still an innocent
You're still an innocentThere's some things you can't speak of
But tonight you'll live it all again
You wouldn't be shattered on the floor now
If only you would sing what you know now thenWasn't it easier in your firefly-catchin' days?
And everything out of reach, someone bigger brought down to you
Wasn't it beautiful runnin' wild 'til you fell asleep?
Before the monsters caught up to you?It's all right, just wait and see
Your string of lights is still bright to me
Oh, who you are is not where you've been
You're still an innocentIt's okay, life is a tough crowd
32, and still growin' up now
Who you are is not what you did
You're still an innocentTime turns flames to embers
You'll have new Septembers
Every one of us has messed up tooLives change like the weather
I hope you remember
Today is never to late to
Be brand newIt's all right, just wait and see
Your string of lights are still bright to me
Oh, who you are is not where you've been
You're still an innocentIt's okay, life is a tough crowd
32, and still growin' up now
Who you are is not what you did
You're still an innocent 
7 years and 50 days, the time is passing by
Nothing in this world can be as nice as you and I
And how could we break up like this?
And how could we be wrong?
So many years, so many days and I still sing my songNow I run to you like I always do

Dolly Parton coverHere you come again
Just when I've begun to get myself together
You waltz right in the door
Just like you've done before
And wrap my heart 'round your little finger
Here you come again
Just when I'm about to make it work without you
You look into my eyes
And light those dreamy eyes
And pretty soon I'm wonderin'
How I came to doubt you
All you gotta do
Is smile that smile
And there go all my defenses
Just leave it up to you
And in a little while
You're messin' up my mind
And fillin' up my sensesHere you come again
Lookin' better than a body
Has a right to
And shakin' me up so
That all I really know
Is here you come againAll you gotta do
Is smile that smile
And there go all my defenses
Just leave it up to you
And in a little while
You're messin' up my mind
And fillin' up my senses 
Its too late baby
Theres no turning around
I got my hands in my pocket
And my head in the clouds
This is how I do
When I think about you
I never thought that you could break me apart
I keep a sinister smile and a whole in my heart
You wanna get inside
Then you can get in line
But not this timeCuz you caught me off guard
Now I'm running and screamingWill you be my hero
And I'll be your heroine
Do you know that your love
Is the sweetest sinOh ooh oh ooh
oh oh yeah
Oh ooh oh ooh
oh oh oh
oh ooh oh ooh
oh oh yeah 
I think of you every single evening
As I lay awake at night.
I try to think; try to walk away with you...me in
And I say:Chorus:
Honey baby don't do anything crazy around us,
Say that everything will be fine!
Oh, honey baby, oh,
How can you blame me,
When I say I wanna make you mine?
Cause everybody else in the world is driving me crazy,
Except you, honey baby!
Oh!Flying high, I can see his smiling,
As we walk down by the drives.
Take my hand, take my breath away,
Cause you make me feel like flying!Chorus:
Honey baby don't do anything crazy around us,
Say that everything will be fine!
Oh, honey baby, oh,
How can you blame me,
When I say I wanna make you mine?
Cause everybody else in the world is driving me crazy,
Except you, honey baby!
Oh!Oh, you are everything I'll ever need
Oh, you are everything I wanna be!
Drive me crazy, have me baby,
All I really wanna say is:Chorus:
Honey baby don't do anything crazy around us,
Say that everything will be fine!
Oh, honey baby, oh,
How can you blame me,
When I say I wanna make you mine?
Cause everybody else in the world is driving me crazy,
Oh, except you, honey baby! 
Once upon a time
We broke up
The first time
You got me alone
We haven't seen each other in a month
When you said you needed space
I realize the blame is on meCause i knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
We are never ever getting back together
We are never ever getting back together
Oh oh, trouble, trouble, trouble
Oh oh, trouble, trouble, troubleNo apologies
He'll never see you cry
I'm really gonna miss you picking fights
He's the reason why
You're drowning, you're drowning, you're drowningi knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
We are never ever getting back together
We are never ever getting back together
Oh oh, trouble, trouble, trouble
Oh oh, trouble, trouble, troubleAnd the saddest fear
Comes creeping in
i used to say "never say never"
Yeah! (No!)i knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
We are never ever getting back together
We are never ever getting back together
Oh oh, trouble, trouble, trouble
Oh oh, trouble, trouble, troubleWe are never ever getting back together
trouble, trouble, troubleWe are never ever getting back together
trouble, trouble, trouble 
{Taylor}
I'm all alone and it's too dark
I need a man on my mark
In times like these I still need a guy
Nick you are so mineHey, Nick I know it's dark but I need you
I'm so alone and I'm too framed but I need you
I don't how I can be without you
I need you{Demi}
I'm still alone inside this cage
Still need a man but it's not the same
In times like these I still need a guy
Joe you are still mineHey, Joe I know it's dark but I need you

In times like these we still need some guys
Yeah, you are still mineHey, guys I know it's dark but I need you
I'm so alone and I'm too framed but I need you
I don't how I can be without you
I need you 
Throwing pennies at the fountain
But when you're standing on a mountain
It's kinda hard to aim.Like the tree we cut our names in
There must be an explanation
Guess it didn't get enough rain.I need reasons why you're leaving.Well I guess I wished on a plane,
I thought it was a star.
Guess what you wrote on the paper wasn't really on your heart
Could've sworn you said you loved me
I guess I heard you wrong.And I guess I wished on a plane,
I thought it was a star.Diving up into the deep end
Honestly believed you'd be there
When I jumped in.Guess it ain't your territory
We had the perfect love story
Except the ending.Back then comes true
And it comes to you now.And I guess I wished on a plane,
I thought it was a star.
Guess what you wrote on the paper wasn't really in your heart
Could've sworn you said you loved me
I guess I heard you wrong.And I guess I wished on a plane,
And I thought it was a star.And that was, it was too cloudy
It's not my fault
I just couldn't seeAnd I guess I wished on a plane,
I thought it was a star.
Guess what you wrote on the paper wasn't really in your heart
Could've sworn you said you loved me
I guess I heard you wrong.And I guess I wished on a plane,
And I thought it was a star.Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh ohThrowing pennies at the fountain
When you're standing on a mountain
It's kind of hard to aim.

I will not get offended.I think one of the cool things about being able to play guitar is that you can play whatever you want. And uh, you can play songs that you wrote or you can play songs that other people wrote or you can play country songs or you can play, you can play this.To the left

Talkin bout
How I'll never find a man like you
Got me twistedYou must not know 'bout me
You must not know 'bout me
I can have another you in a minute
Matter fact
He'll be here in a minute
Baby
You must not know 'bout me
You must not know 'bout me
I can have another you by tomorrow
So don't you ever for a second
Get to thinking
You're irreplacable
Yeah 
She didn't have a reason to go, oh no
She didn't have a reason to stay
Either way she didn't tell anyone about her first ray of sun
She looked at her keys and found a reason to runAnd time stands still when you're nowhere bound
But I understand it somehowIf I could drive all night would I find my peace of mind?
Would it be a million miles of cold white lies?
An unfamiliar exit sign
If I just drive on by just south of knowing whyI didn't really know her that well
But I could tell that her smile was only something to hide behind
She felt so out of touch, just felt too much
If you don't know what you want nothing's ever enoughAnd time stands still when you're nowhere bound
That's where I'm headed right nowIf I could drive all night would I find my peace of mind?
Would it be a million miles of cold white lies?
An unfamiliar exit sign
If I just drive on by just south of knowing whyI don't have a plan, I don't have a map
I don't even know if I'm ever going back
I don't have a when and I don't have a where
I don't even know if I'm knowing I'm thereAnd time stands still when you're nowhere bound
But I understand it somehowBut If I could drive all night would I find my peace of mind?
Would it be a million miles of cold white lies?
An unfamiliar exit sign
If I just drive on by just south of knowing whyI just drive on by, drive on, drive on
Drive all night
If I drive on, drive on, drive on
Drive all night just south of knowing why

Verse 1
You see me giving people weird looks, i cant help it is ma face,
My kind is the odd and quiet type, but i can be loud when i want to,
Dont be a racist idiot, you hate the nazis too,
You're just a fat guy who needs a life, but i'm not helping that task
You tell all your friends that i am real strange,
You cant talk cos your gay,
Fat gay, fat lad, fat man, hanging on the wall,
You need give me space, ortherwise i will.... Nut you.Chorus
You call me a phyco, you dont know what your saying,
You call me every name under the starlit sky,
Get a life, thats worth living, your making mine like hell.
Dont be gay, oops wait, your bi-sexual,
Dont be stupid and wreck your life,
Go away DJ, i aint that phyco, who nutted that lad under the old bridge,
Leave me, leave me, leave me, leave me alone! 
One day break, one heart ache, every once upon a time
That black dress, happiness, bubble baths and quarter lines
They mean so much to everyone,
But you count them up one by one
Clear midnights, and his father, was thinking that your dad was ten feel tall
A blue body afraid of it, quiet winters and leaves that always fall
Your black boots, my red flower ring
They're for the little thingsOil paintings and make it, every details turned out bad
One night stands, new romance, living for that love and person
It means so much to everyone
But you count them up one by one
Clear midnights, and his father, was thinking that your dad was ten feel tall
A blue body afraid of it, quiet winters and leaves that always fall
Your black boots, my red flower ring
They're for the little things, oho, yeah,No fighting, black riding, wish upon a star and give the moon a smile
Pretending, defending, take a risk and go a thought for the right
Strawberries and fairies with wings
They're for the little things,
Na na na, na na na, na na na na, uh yeah
Na na na, na na na, na na na na, oh yeah. 
Your feet under the table
I love it when their touchin' mine
Your hands make the best kind of cradle
To tell me everything is fineAll I can see is you lookin' at me
Do you know when you go
You make the sweetest sight at the window
If you had never come out of the blue
I would've stayed up
And made up youYou smile just like a picture
It doesn't even need a frame
Sometimes I wait to answer
Just to hear you say my nameAnd all I want is just what I've got
Do you know when you go
You make the sweetest sight at the window
If you have never come out of the blue
I would have stayed up
And made up youI'd never let you go
Even if I could
'Cause I never could've dreamed you
Up this goodoh oh ohDo you know when you go
You make the sweetest sight at the window
If you have never come out of the blue
I would've stayed up
And made up youMade up youOh oh
Made up you 
I shined your shoes
I poured the wine
I gave you all of my timeI patched your fake smile
Against your friends
Which apparently is a crimeI gave you space
You took my place
And gave it to herBut life's too long
To waste it all loving a liarAnd when love hands me matches now
I'm gonna burn it downI keyed her car
Got my guitar
And wrote this damn songLook what you've found
She's been around
I hear the lines longAnd don't you tell me
To be nice
I'm not a nice girlShe died from complications
Of the things you told herSo when love hands me matches now
I'm gonna burn it downAin't it funny
You said honey
You meant sitting duck
Well i say cheater, liar, truck on fire, loser, leaver, deceiver
Just a few I've thought ofAnd when love hands me matches now
'Gonna burn it down
I'm gonna burn it down
Oh yeah
Gonna burn it, burn it, burn it downMatches, now 
You're on the phone with your girlfriend
She's upset
She's going off about something that you said
'Cause she doesn't get your humor like I do
I'm in my room
It's a typical Tuesday night
I'm listening to the kind of music she doesn't like
And she'll never know your story like I do'But she wears short skirts
I wear T-shirts
She's cheer captain
And I'm on the bleachers
Dreaming about the day when you wake up
And find that what you're looking for has been here the whole timeIf you can see I'm the one who understands you
Been here all along so why can't you see
You belong with me
You belong with meWalkin' the streets with you and your worn-out jeans
I can't help thinking this is how it ought to be
Laughing on a park bench, thinking to myself
Hey isn't this easyAnd you've got a smile that could light up this whole town
I haven't seen it in a while since she brought you down
You say your fine
I know you better then that
Hey what you doing with a girl like thatShe wears high heels
I wear sneakers
She's cheer captain and I'm on the bleachers
Dreaming about the day when you wake up
And find that what what you're looking for has been here the whole timeIf you can see that I'm the one who understands you
Been here all along so why can't you see
You belong with meStanding by and waiting at your back door
All this time how could you not know
Baby, you belong with me
You belong with meOh, I remember you drivin' to my house in the middle of the night
I'm the one who makes you laugh
When you know you're about to cry
And I know your favorite songs
And you tell me about your dreams
I think I know where you belong
I think I know it's with meCan't you see that I'm the one who understands you
Been here all along so why can't you see
You belong with meStanding by and waiting at your back door
All this time
How could you not know
Baby you belong with me
You belong with meYou belong with me
Have you ever thought just maybe
You belong with me
You belong with me 
Taylor (spoken):
Let me tell you a little bit about Tyler Hilton
Um, I met him a couple months ago
Doing a show out in California
Um and I had met him because he had said some nice things about me in a magazine and said "Ya know I'm a really big fan of Taylor Swift's music" and I read that and I'm like wow thats really cool so I had my management contact his management and he arranged to come be at one of my shows.And so, ya know, I asked him to come out and sing with me.And while he was standing there next to me on stage I said "Tyler, how would you like to be in one of my music videos?" And uh, the crowd, he was kinda silent but the crowd was like "Yeah! Oh my God!" You guys know how to do that?Crowd:
Woo!!Taylor (Spoken):
Thats what I like to hear. Anyways, so he's standing here on stage and I'm like straight up "Do you wanna be in a music video? I'm shooting one in a couple weeks. And uh he goes "Well, I guess. Yeah sure." Because I mean the crowd was going so loud that if he would have said no they would have probably booed him off the stage. Which was kinda my point and asking him on stage. So basically I forced him to be in my music video.Have yall seen that one? Would yall like me to bring him out and do a song with him? Tyler Hilton's in the house tonight! So uh, the song I asked to sing with him um a couple months ago when we had a show together was one that he sings on One Tree Hill. Ya see, Tyler is on the show One Tree Hill because he's cool. He was also in the movie Walk The Line, he played Elvis Presley.So I decided to go all out for my hometown. So uh, Tyler ya gonna sing a song with me?Tyler (spoken):
Yeah
Lets do it!
If ya guys know, sing along too.Taylor:
Everytime I think of you
I always catch my breath
I'm still standing here
And your miles away
And I wonder why you left me
And there's a storm that's raging through my frozen heart tonightTyler:
I hear your name in certain circles
And it always makes me smile
I spent my time just thinkin about you
And its almost driving me wildBut its my heart thats beggin down this long distance line tonightBoth:
And I ain't missin' you at all
Since you've been gone... Away
I ain't missin' you
No matter what I might sayTyler:
There's a message in the wires
And I am sendin' you a signal tonight
You don't know how desperate I've become
And It looks like I'm loosein' this fightBut it's my heart that's breakin' down this long dusty road of mineBoth:
But I ain't missin' you at all
Since you've been gone... Away
I aint missin' you at
No matter what my friends sayTaylor:
And there's a message that I'm sendin' out
Like a telograph to you or something
I can't bridge this distance
Honey, stop this heart ache all aloneBoth:
I ain't missin' you at all
Since you've been gone... Away
I ain't missin' you
No matter what my friends say
I ain't missin' you
Since you've been gone... Away

Verse 1:
I don't want to break your heart
But you just keep on pushing me
I want to walk away
But you have ways of stopping me
I don't know what to say
Its just that I really want to leave
Cause your holding me back, holding me back from the life of luxuryChorus:
So let me go my own way
Opposite from you
I don't care what you have to say
My hearts not in the mood
Though I really love you
You just keep hurting me
You say tell you what to do to make me happy
The only way is for you to let me leaveVerse 2:
When ever we go out
I'm just a friend to you
But when we at home
You want to call me your boo
An I hate the fact
That when she comes around you make me go away
Its like you can't make up your mind
This is all I have to sayChorusBridge:
You say I can count on you
But you just playing games
An I just let it slide
When call her name
You don't get it
I'm trying so hard not to walk away
But see now I'm tired of your two faces
So I'm just going to go my own way
Chorus:
So let me go my own way ( My own way)
Opposite from you ( From you, from you, from you)
I don't care what you have to say
My hearts not in the mood ( Not in the mood)
Though I really love you
You just keep hurting me ( You just keep hurting me)
You say tell you what to do to make me happy
The only way is for you to let me leave ( Let me leave)So let me go my own way
Opposite from you
I don't care what you have to say
My hearts not in the mood
Though I really love you
You just keep hurting me
You say tell you what to do to make me happy
The only way is for you to let me leave
Let me leave, an go my own way
Let me leave, an go my own way
Let me leave, an go my own way
Let me leave, an go my own way 
On a crowded highway
Through a night alone
I was barely breathing
I was crawling home
Well, it's quite not London
Or the south of France
Or an Asian Island
Or a second chanceGoing back to Nashville
Thinking 'bout the whole thing
Guess you gotta run sometimes
Maybe I'm a fast train
Blowin' through a valley
Watching all my life go byYou're a distant memory
You're an exit sign
I was talking crazy
On the drivers side
And I know I hurt you
But I can't confess
Was that blood or a wine stain
On your wedding dressGoing back to Nashville
Thinking 'bout the whole thing
Guess you gotta run sometimes
Maybe I'm a fast train
Blowing through a mountain
Watching all my life go byGoing back to Nashville
Laughing at a bad break
What's the use of wondering why?
Maybe I'm a storm front
Blowing through a valley
Tearing up a good JulyAnd its safe and warm
Where nothing ever happens
Could it be so hard
To realign a star for you
Change a southern man for youGoing back to Nashville
Thinking bout the whole thing
Guess you gotta run sometimes
Maybe I'm a fast train
Blowing though a valley
Tearing up a good JulyI'm going back to Nashville
Laughing at a bad break
What's the use of wondering why?
Maybe I'm a storm front
Blowing through the valley
Tearing up a good JulyGoing back to NashvilleI'm going back to NashvilleGoing back to Naaaaahh....Going back to Nashville
What's the use of wondering why? 
I need you now
Read letters that i wrote on the wall
And the message that i left on my car
I need you now
Words that said drowned out by the rain
Waiting there for you but you never came
My world's a little colder now
But i'm keeping warm somehowSo here you are at my window
Guess nobody told you
I don't need you, don't need you
And i waited so frustrated
Who's gonna hold you
I don't need you, don't need you nowI need you now
Words i heard you whispered to me
And we will walk you down a one-way street
You need me now
That's what you've been telling my friends
But i'd come too far to go back there again
My heart, my mind, my mother's a chain
Your mind as well forget my nameSo here you are at my window
Guess nobody told you
I don't need you, don't need you
And i waited so frustrated
Who's gonna hold you
I don't need you, don't need you nowI need you now
Read letters that i wrote on the wall
And the message that i left on my carSo here you are at my window
Guess nobody told you
I don't need you, don't need you
And i waited so frustrated
Who's gonna hold you
I don't need you nowAnd i'm not what you want
I won't wonder where you are
I won't dream a thousand stars
I don't need you now
I don't need you by the rain
And i never heard you say
I need you, i need you
I don't need you now
Don't need you
I don't need you now 
You got that long hair, slicked back, white t-shirt.
& I got that good girl fig and a tight little skirt,
And when we go crashing down, we come back in every time.
Cause we never go out of style. Take me home.
(You got the look, you got the look) 
Look at you
Look at me
Look at who
We could beI wanna know
Who you are
What you want
From the starsAnd every time I look at you
I can hardly say a thing
My head starts to spin
And it hits me then
I love youAnd every time you look at me
I could go crazy but I don't
Say it but I won't
'Cause I'd rather be alone
Than loose youAnd all I really wanna do is be next to you
But I'm too tired to fight
And I could tell you now but baby NEVERMINDAll the time
Everyday
There's nothing I can do baby
To make you go awaySo look at you
And look at me
And look at who we could beAnd every time I look at you
I can hardly say a thing
My head starts to spin
And it hits me then
I love youAnd every time you look at me
I could go crazy but I don't
Say it but I won't
'Cause I'd rather be alone
Than loose youAnd all I really wanna do is be next to you
But I'm too tired to fight
And I could tell you now but baby NEVERMINDAll I really wanna say is "I miss you babe"
But how could you understand?
What happens if you turn away
And everything turns blue and grey
And I just wish I told you NEVERMIND?
And I could tell you now but baby NEVERMIND.Yeah, oh yeah, yeah, yeahAnd I could tell you now but baby NEVERMINDYeah, oh yeah,I could tell you now but baby NEVERMIND 
(talking)
wow its been at least 5 years since I've seen her. pfft its hard to believe
(start singing)
I cant believe its been that long, why didnt your call, why didnt you write. was it cause of him or was it just cause you dont love me anymore. you could have found some way to contact me.
(chorus)
But i know its not my fault
once hes gone i know you'll start to come around
i know its his fault now, you should have told me sooner, i wouldnt have had to live my life this way
(sing softly)
Now that he's gone will i get to see you again
at least hear your voice again
I think its gonna workout this time around
we can be a family again not like before is gonna e different,
were gonna do lots of stuff together I think it's gonna work out this time around not like before
(chorus)
but i know it's not my fault
once he's gone i know youll start to come around
i know its his fault now, you should have told me sooner I wouldnt have had to live my life this way cause i know its not my fault now 
She said: I was seven and you were nine
I looked at you like the stars that shine
In the sky, the pretty lightsAnd our daddies used to joke about the two of us
Growin up and fallin in love
And our mamas smiled
And rolled their eyes
And said oh my, my, my...Take me back to the house with the backyard tree
Said you'd beat me up you were bigger than me
You never did
You never did
Take me back when our world was one block wide
I dared you to kiss me and ran when you tried
Just two kids
You and I
Oh my my my myWell I was sixteen when suddeny
I wasnt that little girl you used to see
But your eyes still shined
Like pretty lights.
And our daddies used to joke about the two of us
They never believed we'd really fall in love
And our mamas smiled
And rolled their eyes
And said oh my, my, myTake me back to the creek those weeks in love
Two AM ridin in your truck
And all I need
Is you next to me
Take me back to the time we had our very fist fight
The slammin of doors 'stead of kissin goodnight
You stayed outside
Til the morning light
Oh my, my, my, myA few years head gone and come around
We were sittin at our favorite spot in town
And you looked at me
Got down on one kneeTake me back to the time
When we walked down the aisle
The whole town came and our mamas cried
You said I do
And I did too
Took me home where we met so many years before
We'll rock our babies on that very front porch
After all this time
You and II'll be 87 youll be 89
I'll still look at you like the stars that shine
In the sky
Oh my, my, my... 
If you love me then I love you
Swear by the freckles on the moon
And maybe this will be enoughI'd like to keep you 'till I'm old
But if I can't at least I'll know
That baby, Perfect Have I LovedDo you remember the stupid things we used to do?
Before September stole me away from you
The time we got your truck stuck in the creek
'Cos baby, roads weren't wild enough for you and meSayin'If you love me then I love you
Swear by the freckles on the moon
And maybe this will be enough
I'd like to keep you till I'm old
But if I can't at least I'll know
That baby, Perfect Have I LovedI used to see you by the bridge we used to cross
I found the feeling of trying to get lost
You would smile that smile that I tried so hard to forget
It's hard to douse a fire that I still haven't put out yetAnd if you love me then I love you
Swear by the freckles on the moon
And maybe this will be enough
I'd like to keep you till I'm old
But if I can't at least I'll know
That baby, Perfect Have I LovedLove was all we knew
And faith was growing on the vines
Words were all we had
And for one Summer you were mineSayin'If you love me then I love you
Swear by the freckles on the moon
And maybe, this will be enough
I'd like to keep you till I'm old
But if I can't at least I'll know
That baby, Perfect Have I Loved 
State the obvious
I didn't get my perfect fantasy
I realize you love yourself more than you could ever love me
So go and tell your friends that I'm obsessive and crazy
That's fine!
I'll tell mine
You're gay
By the wayI hate that
Stupid old pickup truck
You never let me drive
You're a redneck heartbreak
Who's really bad at lying
So watch me strike a match
On all my wasted time
As far as I'm concerned you're
Just another picture to burnThere's no time for tears
I'm just sitting here
Planning my revenge
There's nothing stopping me
From going out with all of your best friends
And if you come around saying sorry to me
My daddy's gonna show you how sorry you'll be'Cause I hate that
Stupid old pickup truck
You never let me drive
You're a redneck heartbreak
Who's really bad at lying
So watch me strike a match
On all my wasted time
As far as I'm concerned you're
Just another picture to burnIf you're missing me
You'd better keep it to yourself
'Cause coming back around here
Would be bad for your health'Cause I hate that
Stupid old pickup truck
You never let me driveYou're a redneck heartbreak
Who's really bad at lyingSo watch me strike a match
On all my wasted time
In case you haven't heardI really really hate that
Stupid old pickup truck
You never let me drive
You're a redneck heartbreak
Who's really bad at lying
So watch me strike a match
On all my wasted time
As far as I'm concerned you're
Just another picture to burnBurn, burn, burn, baby, burn
Just another picture to burn
Baby, burn

Til the day that he died
He wanted my mother, my brother, my sister, and me
To grow up and live freeBoth:

Brought to you courtesy

Loving him is like driving a new Maserati down a dead-end street
Faster than the wind, passionate as sin ending so suddenly
Loving him is like trying to change your mind once you're already flying through the free fall
Like the colors in autumn, so bright just before they lose it allLosing him was blue like I'd never known
Missing him was dark grey all alone
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you never met
But loving him was red
Loving him was redTouching him was like realizing all you ever wanted was right there in front of you
Memorizing him was as easy as knowing all the words to your old favorite song
Fighting with him was like trying to solve a crossword and realizing there's no right answer
Regretting him was like wishing you never found out that love could be that strongLosing him was blue like I'd never known
Missing him was dark gray all alone
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you never met
But loving him was red
Oh red
Burning redRemembering him comes in flashbacks and echoes
Tell myself it's time now, gotta let go
But moving on from him is impossible
When I still see it all in my head
Burning red
Burning it was redOh losing him was blue like I'd never known
Missing him was dark gray all alone
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you never met
'Cause loving him was red
Yeah, yeah red
We're burning redAnd that's why he's spinning 'round in my head
Comes back to me, burning red
Yeah, yeah
His love was like driving a new Maserati down a dead-end street 
Now go stand in the corner and think about what you did
Ha, time for a little revengeThe story starts when it was hot and it was summer
And, I had it all I had him right there where I wanted him
She came along, got him alone, and let's hear the applause
She took him faster than you could say sabotage
I never saw it coming, nor would I have suspected it
I underestimated just who I was dealing with
She had to know the pain was beating on me like a drum
She underestimated just who she was stealing fromShe's not a saint and she's not what you think
She's an actress, whoa
She's better known for the things that she does
On the mattress, whoa
Soon she's gonna find
Stealing other people's toys on the playground
Won't make you many friends
She should keep in mind,
She should keep in mind
There is nothing I do better than revenge, haShe looks at life like it's a party and she's on the list
She looks at me like I'm a trend and she's so over it
I think her ever present frown is a little troubling
And, she thinks I'm psycho
'Cause I like to rhyme her name with things, but
Sophistication isn't what you wear, or who you know
Or pushing people down to get you where you wanna go
Oh they didn't teach you that in prep school
So it's up to me
But no amount of vintage dresses gives you dignity
(Think about what you did)She's not a saint and she's not what you think
She's an actress, whoa
She's better known for the things that she does
On the mattress, whoa
Soon she's gonna find
Stealing other people's toys on the playground
Won't make you many friends
She should keep in mind,
She should keep in mind
There is nothing I do better than revenge, haI'm just another thing for you to roll your eyes at honey
You might have him, but haven't you heard
I'm just another thing for you to roll your eyes at honey
You might have him, but I'll always get the last word
WhoaShe's not a saint and she's not what you think
She's an actress, whoa
She's better known for the things that she does
On the mattress, whoa
Soon she's gonna find
Stealing other people's toys on the playground
Won't make you many friends
She should keep in mind,
She should keep in mind
There is nothing I do better than revenge, haAnd do you still feel like you know what you're doing,
'Cause I don't think you do, oh
Do you still feel like you know what you're doing
I don't think you do, I don't think you do
Let's hear the applause
C'mon show me how much better you are
See you deserve some applause
'Cause you're so much better
She took him faster than you could say sabotage 
Let's watch the tide chase the waves onto the sand
I wonder if a broken heart feel the warmth on my hand
Don't wonder how a piece of driftwood could see more through his lifetime
Let's walk away the past through the smokey black nightsI've seen a million things
spoke a million words
now i only want to speak to youWaiting for the words
counting every bird
there's nothing i'd rather do
on smokey black nightsStill through the haze i can make out constellations
I'll make one of you and me as we sit in the sand
And i saw that sunset gleamin as my eyes went wild
Let's walk away the past through the smokey black nightsI've played a thousand songs
sang a thousand words
now i only want to sing to youWaited on a wire
starin at the fire
there's nothing i'd rather do
on the smokey black nightsYeahI've walked a thousand miles
smiled a thousand smiles
Now I only smile when I'm with youWaiting for the words
counting every bird
there's nothing i'd rather do
on the smokey black nightsSo walk with me
As the sweet wind dances
I'm writing a song for you and me
On the smokey black nights 
You were the guy I always dreamed of. You were the guy that I loved. But then you had to leave me.
I asked when you would call me. You replied meet me at the wildernes at nine. I went there standin waitin to see your face.... You never showed up I was there for hours, I was watin to see your face. Ill stand here for hours under this lonly spot light.
Ill wait all night till I see your face. Ohh waitin to see your face. I went to the mall with all my friends to see if you were there I saw you with another girl I didnt think to swear. I wen home crying to see if you were there If a message was left I would cry my tears.I was watin to see your face. Ill stand here for hours under this lonly spot light.
Ill wait all night till I see your face. Ohh waitin to see your face. Then I had your call for me and I saw your face lookin at me I was glad to see! We went we cried to the the wilderness---Im not alone.. Under the spot light any more.... Any more--- any more--- ANY MORE!

Hello, Good day
But what I do know, it that tonight is gonna be the night, whenChorus:
He says I love you and I really care about you
When, He says he'll hold me in his arms when I'm afraid
When, I'll say, Oh, I'll say I love him too
And, I care about you, yeah this ain't no charade.
Then he'll drive me home listenin' to the radio
Then, He says he really loves me too and do anythingOh, I walk through the door there's a beautiful moonlight shine
Across the room
I crawl into bed thinkin' what I did today
With him
But what I do know, is that, I love him too.
And the next time I see, him walking down the street (down the street)
I'll think about this time, that was as beautiful sunshine.Oh!Chorus:
He says I love you and I care about you
Yeah, He says he'll hold in his arms when I'm afraid.
And I'll say, I love you too, yeah, I love you

Then he'll drive me home, listenin' to the radio
Then, He says, he really loves me and he'll do anythingBridge:
I look in his brown eyes
And I see a surprise
It's like a present that you open
Oh, and do know oh do you know

By the way that you treat me
Hopefully, you don't leave me

And recreate a place that's my own world
And i could be your favorite girl
Forever, perfectly together

DJ:
Hey a little bit ago we were talking about uh, songwriting and listening to songs and putting down what you feel in the song and um up next in the countdown is Taylor Swift and have you heard this song yet?Tim McGraw:
I Have heard this song.DJ:
Tim McGraw. And what what did you think the first time you heard it? Or how was the first time?Tim:
It was awesome. Uh except for I didn't know if I should I should take it as a compliment or I should feel old.DJ:
A ha ha haTim:
I didn't know which one but the more, the more I hear it the more...I don't know if its true or not but I start taking it as a compliment and not that I feel that I'm old. I don't know if that's true but that's what I choose to think.DJ:
Why don't we find out. Taylor is a compliment or uh he's old?Taylor:
Oh its definitely a compliment. Yeah(Laughing)DJ:
Tim McGraw meet Taylor Swift.Tim:
Nice-Taylor:
Nice to meet you.Tim:
Nice to meet you, Taylor. How you doing?Taylor:
I'm doing great. How are you doing?Tim:
I'm doing good. Congratulations on your record. It's doing great.Taylor:
Thank you so much. I'm just so excited. Thank you for uh having good music and everything. I swear I'm not a stalker.(laughing)DJ:
Well-Taylor:
The funny thing about this song is ya know, as a writer some of the songs that you write like 4 hours you'll do them writing a song and it'll be good and everything but, I wrote this one in literally 15 minutes and ya know I really didn't think anything about calling in Tim McGraw so. I kinda shelved it for like 3 months and never even thought that it was going to be a single. But um my label heard it and was like we're putting that out.(laughing)Tim:
Well I'm glad ya did cuz um it's doing well for ya.DJ:
So I-
So I understand that you two guys have not talked.Tim:
No.DJ:
You haven't met.Tim:
No.Taylor:
No, we've never talked or met or anything.Tim:
I sent her a message one time. I think with Entertainment Weekly or something like that. Oh I don't remember what show it was. I was doing an interview and they were going to interview Taylor the next day. So, I sent her a little message. So, I don't know if she got it or not.Taylor:
Oh my God. They never gave that to me.Tim:
They didn't? Ok well, there ya go. I did.(laughing)DJ:
So I-ITaylor:
We've just officially never never talked or messaged or anything.Tim:
Not at all.DJ:
So I thought, I think it's pretty brave to put out a song called Tim McGraw without maybe talking to Tim McGraw. Did you mind?Taylor:
It was definitely kind of a chance. Ya know I did say anything bad in the song so I was kinda thinking ya know, he wouldn't take it too bad.Tim:
Well, thank you for that. Thank you for not saying anything bad. I'm sure there's plenty that could've been said. Tell me-Taylor:
Could you tell Faith that I said hello?Tim:
I sure will. I sure will. And she loves the song too by the way.Taylor:
Oh my gosh, she's awesome.Tim:
I agree.DJ:
This, this...Tell me about writing a song. Um did this, did this really happen?Taylor:
Well, yeah. I mean, I never really kinda went into this writing session on I'm gonna write a song called Tim McGraw. Um, yeah. because, that would just be weird. But um...(laughing)Taylor:
I actually this this is kinda strange but I actually came up with the melody and ideas for this song in math class in my freshman year of high school.Tim:
Now I feel old.Taylor:
And um I was sitting there and was kind of started singing it to myself and I was going through a period where I was dating this guy that was going off to college and I knew we were gonna break up. So I started to think about all the things that I knew would remind him of me. And its kinda like a given one of all my friends ya know that my favorite songs are Tim McGraw songs. They just are.Tim:
Aww, thank you.Taylor:
And uh, you know so I kinda just thought about that first and so it pointed to the song and just sat down at that piano and wrote it with this co-writer who was kinda wondering if I was crazy or not but it turned out alright. And ya know, the funny thing is that I shelved this song for like 3 months and never never even played it for anybody, never even demoed it. And uh, then one time I was just goofing around and played it for my record label president and he goes "well thats your first single"(laughing)Taylor:
And I'm like wellTim:
Well you can write songs about me anytime, Taylor.(laughing)Taylor:
Thats awesome. There's a part two coming out next month.Tim:
Alright, great.(laughing)Tim:
Well congratulations cuz its your first single, first top ten hit and thats pretty exciting and I know you're off to the races here. You're just doing great and uh congratulations very exciting for you.Taylor:
Awesome, its been so exciting. Tim, when are you gonna start like bringing out opening acts again?Tim:
Um I dont know. I don't know. We'll have to look into that.(laughing)Taylor:
Well I'll, I have someone who I think will be really perfect for it.Tim:
ya do? What would-Taylor:
Yeah.Tim:
What would their name be?Taylor:
Uh, um I think Taylor something.Tim:
Something like that yeah.Taylor:
But,Tim:
Well I'll, I'll be more than happy to have you out with me.Taylor:
Just consider it.DJ:
Ah, well thats very good. You're pretty fearless Taylor Swift. I'll tell ya that.Tim:
Right she's, she's gonna be forward this time.DJ:
I think so. Country Countdown USA is now a booking agency as well.Tim:
Absolutely.DJ:

It was awesome and thank you. It was good to meet you Tim.Tim:

Drew looks at me, I fake a smile so he won't see
That I want and I'm needing everything that we should be
I'll bet she's beautiful, that girl he talks about
And she's got everything that I have to live withoutDrew talks to me, I laugh 'cause it is just so funny
That I can't even see anyone when he's with me
He says he's so in love, he's finally got it right,
I wonder if he knows he's all I think about at nightHe's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
He's the song in the car I keep singing, don't know why I doDrew walks by me, can he tell that I can't breathe?
And there he goes, so perfectly,
The kind of flawless I wish I could be
She'd better hold him tight, give him all her love
Look in those beautiful eyes and know she's lucky causeHe's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
He's the song in the car I keep singing, don't know why I doSo I drive home alone, as I turn out the light
I'll put his picture down and maybe
Get some sleep tonightBecause he's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only one who's got enough of me to break my heart
He's the song in the car I keep singing, don't know why I do
He's the time taken up, but there's never enough
And he's all that I need to fall intoDrew looks at me, I fake a smile so he won't see 
(Spoken:)

I remember tears streaming down your face
When I said, "I'll never let you go"
When all those shadows almost killed your light
I remember you said, "Don't leave me here alone"
But all that's dead and gone and passed tonightJust close your eyes
The sun is going down
You'll be alright
No one can hurt you now
Come morning light
You and I'll be safe and soundDon't you dare look out your window, darling,
Everything's on fire
The war outside our door keeps raging on

She acts like shes 5 years old
since its cold shes got her big coat on
I hear people laugh at her
i look up bored
and she cries and runs
We star throwing stuff at her and she tries to hide
this starts to get old
She hugs her legs
and we put her to sleep
im forced to take her homeAnd shes stupid to know why the trees change in the fall.
And i know that she is scared
of every little thing and all
She thinks snow whites house very near how dumb
but i know we had the worst day
ever today.she starts acting like shes 13 and thinks everyone is mean
She starts crying
And i push her away
and cut her with my keys
and she starts to drive and drive until she found a town far enough away
And she sulks and walks and tries to forget all our namesAnd she know if shes ever going to finish school
And she knows shell never laugh
cause we shrunk and she grew
she dont know how lng itll take to feel okay
but she knows she had the wors day ever todayShe had a bullying father
She thought she was getting stronger
Her mom beats up her little brother
inside and out hes more popular than she is
She grew up in an ugly house
and had no space to run
and she had the worst days with methere was a video i found from back when we were three
she was trying to paint in the kitchen and she was talking to me
it was the age of teasing and bullying and throwing eggs at her window
And her dad was super dumb
and i was the most handsome boy
in the whole wide worldand now she knows why
all the trees change in the fall
and she knows i was never on her side
and always said she was wrong
and she hates me
for giving her the evil eyes
and making her feel like
she could shine
and i dont know if she knew
so im taking this chance to say
that i always have the worst days
when im with you. 
they don't think our love will last.
they say we're moving much to fast
just because our love is new.
doesn't mean it can't be true.
our love is young and so are we,
i love you and you love me,
but they don't believe us,
cause' they don't know us,
they don't know us we can see,
they won't listen to you and me,
instead of trying to change our plans,
why not give us a helping hand.
just like Juliette loved romeo,
sometimes others don't always know.
but they won't help us,
cause they don't know us.choruswhy not give us a chance and see,
just how true our love can be,
they know you and they know me,
but they don't know us,
. (music turnaround)
they say we're young and love is blind,
we should give this some more time,
did they forget they were young like us,
all we ask is a little trust.we love each other can't they see
isn't that the way it's supposed to be.
they know you --and they know me,
but they don' know us,
music intro
i hope soon your folks and mine,
will get together and take the time,
and get to know us,
really get to know us.
why not give us a chance ' and see
just how strong our love can be.
they know you, and they know me,
but they don't know us.
ooh woo a woo owho yeah
they don't know us that's for sure ,
we're not their little children anymore.
just because our love is new,
doesn't mean it can't be true
why not give us a chance and see,
how true love is suppose to be,
they know you and they know me,
but they don't know us..
yes they know you and they know me,
but they just don't know us,

I said Yo (yup)
You guys bleeped me and I didn't even say anything
I didn't even swear (She didn't even swear)
Hello? Ugh! 
Do you remember the day
I leaned up against your car
And it started rolling down the street
You screamed and ran after it
And tried to open the door
And it ran over your foot
And I was too busy laughing on the ground to see.It would take Brad Pitt to leave you
It takes five seconds to need you
When I'm mad at all the lovebirds
'Cause they don't know to play our song
I wish that pretty girls couldn't see you
I wish that all your roads would lead you right to me
'Cause that's where you belong
Until Brad Pitt comes alongDo you remember the time we watched Carrie
And you said it reminded you of me
And I threw the remote at you
And you said "my point exactly"
And later on that night, under the neon city lights,
You paid a homeless guy to sing a song to me.It would take Brad Pitt to leave you
It takes five seconds to need you
When I'm mad at all the lovebirds
'Cause they don't know to play our song
I wish that pretty girls couldn't see you
I wish that all your roads would lead you right to me
'Cause that's where you belong
Until Brad Pitt comes alongYou call me lucky 'cause I lose everything
But I swear I'd be careful with it
If you gave me a ringAnd it would take Brad Pitt to leave you
It takes five seconds to need you
When I'm mad at all the lovebirds
'Cause they don't play our song
I wish that pretty girls wouldn't see you
I wish that all your roads would lead you right to me
'Cause that's where you belong
Until Brad Pitt comes along
'Til Brad Pitt comes along
Yeah, oh oh
Until Brad Pitt comes along 
Verse1:
You take all the words you said to her and put them up as a wall of gray,protecting yourself from the world that you believe in, i didn't know youwould be able to say all the things you did so i take them and put them up as a wall of gray, protecting myself from the world i believe in
Chorus1:
She didn't have a reason to cry like she did over you, while you ignored the world and listend to the fray,and you said you wouldn't be imbarassed if you said that word again but we both go imbarassed when we said her name
Verse2:
the words written on the wall didn't have anything against anybody, were not in a war so what are we fighting for, i don't know so just shut-up and say all the thing you've wanted to say, the page filled with words in gray and it's about you
Chorus2:
I've never been anywher cold as you,you give rainy endings to perfect days, that's why i hate you for who you are
Verse3:
If you were the only thing i needed we wouldn't be this way, so she just said everything, everybody wanted her to say,but i'm not gonna say it oh,no,no,no
Chorus3:
She didn't have a reason to cry like she did over you, you promised me everything i wanted but you gave it to everybody else instead, but you never gave us a damn thing so we cry,cry alone or is it together i don't know 
I've never gone with the windJust let it flowLet it take me where it wants to goTill you open the doorThere's so much moreI've never seen it before
I was trying to flyBut I couldn't find wings Then you came alongAnd you changed everything
You lift my feet off the groundSpin me around You make me crazier, crazierFeels like I'm falling and II'm lost in your eyesYou make me crazier, Crazier, crazier
Watched from a distance as youMade life your ownEvery sky was your own kind of blueAnd I wanted to knowHow that would feelAnd you made it so real
You showed me something that I couldn't seeYou opened my eyes and you made me believe
You lift my feet off the ground'Spin me around You make me crazier, crazier Feels like I'm falling and II'm lost in your eyesYou make me crazier, Crazier, crazier, ohh......
Baby, you showed me what living is forI don't want to hide anymore..... more....
You lift my feet off the ground,spin me around You make me crazier, crazierFeels like I'm falling and II'm lost in your eyesYou make me crazier, Crazier, crazierCrazier, crazier 
It feels like a perfect night to dress up like hipsters
And make fun of our exes, uh uh uh uh
It feels like a perfect night for breakfast at midnight
To fall in love with strangers uh uh uh uh
Yeaaaah
We're happy free confused and lonely at the same time
It's miserable and magical oh yeah
Tonight's the night when we forget about the deadlines, it's time uh uhI don't know about you but im feeling 22
Everything will be alright if you keep me next to you
You don't know about me but I bet you want to
Everything will be alright if we just keep dancing like we're 22, 22It seems like one of those nights
This place is too crowded too many cool kids
It seems like one of those nights
We ditch the whole scene and end up dreaming instead of sleeping
Yeaaaah
We're happy free confused and lonely in the best way
It's miserable and magical oh yeah
Tonight's the night when we forget about the heartbreaks, it's time uh uhI don't know about you but im feeling 22
Everything will be alright if you keep me next to you
You don't know about me but I bet you want to
Everything will be alright if we just keep dancing like we're 22, 22I don't know about you, 22, 22It feels like one of those nights
We ditch the whole scene
It feels like one of those nights
We won't be sleeping
It feels like one of those nights
You look like bad news I gotta have you, I gotta have youI don't know about you but im feeling 22
Everything will be alright if you keep me next to you

You look like bad news I gotta have you, I gotta have you! 
You had my heart, we'll never be worlds apart
Maybe in magazines but you'll still be my star
Baby 'cause in the dark, you can't see shiny cars
That's when you need me there, with you I'll always shareBecause when the sun shines we'll shine together
Told you I'll be here forever
Said I'll always be your friend
Took an oath, I'ma stick it out to the endNow that it's raining more than ever
Know that we'll still have each other
You can stand under my umbrella
You can stand under my umbrella-ella-ella-ay-ay-ay
Under my umbrella-ella-ella-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ayJust trying to get your attention

I love you and I'd never break your heartyou were so perfect

and gave me everything i ever wanted(Chorus:)
Going out for dinner every night
Cuddling while were watching our favorite movies

We used to walk along the street
When the porch lights were shining bright
Before I had somewhere to be
Back when we had all night
And we were happyI do recall a good while back
We snuck into the circus
You threw your arms around my neck
Back when I deserved it
And we were happyWhen it was good baby,
It was good baby
We showed 'um all up
No one could touch the way we
Laughed in the dark
Talking 'bout your daddy's farm
We were gonna buy someday
And we were happyWe used to watch the sun go down
On the boats in the water
That's sorta how I feel right now
And Goodbye's so much harder
'Cause we were happyWhen it was good baby,
It was good baby
We showed 'um all up
No one could touch the way we
Laughed in the dark
Talking 'bout your daddy's farm
We were gonna buy someday
And we were happyOh, I hate those voices
Telling me I'm not in love anymore
But they don't give me choices
And that's what these tears are for
'Cause we were happyWe Were HappyWhen it was good baby,
It was good baby
We showed 'um all up
No one could touch the way we
Laughed in the dark
Talking 'bout your daddy's farm
And you were gonna marry me
When we were happyYeah, We were were happy

Shes looking in the mirror
The moments getting nearer
She thinks about it as she walks her walk
Up and down the staircase
Makeup fresh on her face
She thinks about it as she talks her talk
School dance, first chance, always been a dreamer
Theres one guy, shes shy, sees him through the mirror
And everybody looks at her,
She thinks about itBlue dress angel face, looking in the mirror,
Shoes,purse, hair tied back and you should see her,
Shes got her magic, floating through the air,Peace,Love,One thing leads into another
Dream big,Aim small
Man you gotta love her
She's got her hopes up
Got 'em up to there
Wonderin' what to wearShe's standing in her bedroom
He'll be pullin' up soon
She thinks about it as she sees headlights
Looking out the window she's got her diary to show
That she's been waiting for this all her life
First date,can't wait
Lookin' in the mirror
Heart all wrapped up
Wait until he sees her
He's lookin' right at her
She thinks about itSixteen blue jeans Abercrombie t-shirt
Shoes purse hair tied back and you should see her
She's got her magic floating through the airPeace, Love,One thing leads into another
Dream big, Aim small
Man you gotta love her
She's got her hopes up
Got 'em up to there
Wonderin' what to wearThe years went by
The mirror saw her cry
She got up again
She got up again
The wind blew by the small town lights
She got up againMove out
Find out where the world can take her
Bright lights late nights livin' for the greater
Move to Paris livin' on a prayerPeace, Love,One thing leads into another
Dream big, Aim small
Man you gotta love her
She's got her hopes up
Got 'em up to there
She's got her hopes up
Got 'em up to there
Wonderin' what to wear
Ooo Ooo
Wonderin' what to wear 
You walk in here with your guitar man
Your shiny boots and your full on band
A smile on your face, a knife in your hand
Singing songs you got memorized
With whatever talent money buys
So polished that it slips right through your handsDon't worry yourself I ain't your competition
Don't flatter yourself that was never my intentionI wanna talk about what you are that I ain't
Let's talk about what you do that I can't
Let's talk about me and you in an empty room
And who wins
Let's talk about what you did to get here
Let's talk about blood and sweat and tears
Let's talk about what you wanna be
And who I've always beenI walk in here with a beat up case
The same guitar I've always played
And the words I wrote down on a page
When I was 12 years old and small town raised
You tell the crowd you're paying dues
I tell them this is what I do
And it's what I put my life into
As I breathe the smoke and cheap perfumeThey say life on music row is rough conditions
Oh, but the easy ride was never my ambitionI wanna talk about what you are that I ain't
Let's talk about what you do that I can't
Let's talk about me and you in an empty room
And who wins
Let's talk about what you did to get here
Let's talk about blood and sweat and tears
Let's talk about what you wanna be
And who I've always beenLet's talk about your childhood days
You were the prom queen, I was on this stage
So where's that crown gotten you these days?
When it's me and you and the same damn games
So what've you got that I ain't?
And what do you do that I can't?
Let's put me and you in an empty room and see who wins
Let's talk about what you did to get here
Let's talk about blood and sweat and tears
Let's talk about what you wanna be, girl
And who I've always been 
He said let's get out of this town
Drive out of the city
Away from the crowds
I thought heaven can't help me now
Nothing lasts forever
But this is gonna take me down
He's so tall, and handsome as hell
He's so bad but he does it so well
I can see the end as it begins my one condition isSay you'll remember me
Standing in a nice dress, staring at the sunset babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again even if it's just in your wildest dreams (Ah ah)
Wildest dreams (Ah ah)I said no one has to know what we do
His hands are in my hair, his clothes are in my room
And his voice is a familiar sound, nothing lasts forever
But this is getting good now
He's so tall, and handsome as hell
He's so bad but he does it so well
And when we've had our very last kiss
But my last request it isSay you'll remember me
Standing in a nice dress, staring at the sunset babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again even if it's just in your wildest dreams (Ah ah) (Ah ah)
Wildest dreams (Ah ah)You see me in hindsight
Tangled up with you all night
Burn it down
Some day when you leave me
I bet these memories hunt you around
You see me in hindsight
Tangled up with you all night
Burn it down (Burn it down)
Some day when you leave me
I bet these memories follow you around (Follow you around)Say you'll remember me
Standing in a nice dress, staring at the sunset babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again even if it's just pretendSay you'll remember me
Standing in a nice dress, staring at the sunset babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again even if it's just (Just pretend, just pretend) in your wildest dreams (Ah ah)
In your wildest dreams (Ah ah)
Even if it's just in your wildest dreams (Ah ah)
In your wildest dreams (Ah ah) 
I can't believe you did it again, walk by and took my heart with you
Why'd you have to look so good, don't you know I'm trying to hate you
Tryin' to have a dream without you in it, but how can I put out this fire
When you're the one that lit it?
I can't wait for the day I stop pretending that I'm really okay when I'm not
I wanna know how it feels to be over you for real, until I do
I keep writing songs about youI got a stack of papers so high and it's all about you baby
Keep thinking maybe I can make sense of something crazy
Something I can get out of my head
I write your name, I write your name, and I tear it all to shreds
I can't wait for the day I stop pretending that I'm really okay when I'm not
I wanna know how it feels to be over you for real, until I do
I keep writing songs about youAnd if you ever change your mind you want me back again
I hope these songs will remind me why I shouldn't let you inI can't wait for the day I stop pretending that I'm really okay, cause I'm not
I wanna know how it feels to be over you for real, till I do
I'll just wait for the day, I'll stop pretending that I'm really okay when I'm not
I wanna know how it feels to be over you for real, till I do
I keep writing songs about you. 
(Hey hey hey)
(Hey hey hey)
(Hey hey hey)
(Hey hey hey)
People like you always want back the love they gave away
And people like me wanna believe you when you say you've changed
The more I think about it now the less I know
All I know is that you drove us off the roadStay, hey, all you had to do was stay
Had me in the palm of your hand
Then, why'd you had to go and lock me out when I let you in
Stay, hey, now you say you want it
Back now that it's just too late
Well could've been easy
All you had to do was stayAll you had to do was stay
All you had to do was stay
All you had to do was stay
All you had to do was stayHere you are now, calling me up, but I don't know what to say
I've been picking up the pieces of the mess you made
People like you always want back the love they pushed aside
But people like me are gone forever when you say goodbyeStay, hey, all you had to do was stay
Had me in the palm of your hand
Then, why'd you had to go and lock me out when I let you in
Stay, hey, now you say you want it
Back now that it's just too late
Well could've been easy
All you had to do was stayAll you had to do was stay
All you had to do was stay
All you had to do was stay (Stay, stay, stay)Let me remind you this was what you wanted (Oh oh oh)
You ended it
You were all I wanted (Oh oh oh)
But not like this
Not like this
Not like this
Oh, all you had to do was stayHey, all you had to do was stay
Had me in the palm of your hand

One look, dark room
Men just for you
Time moved too fast
You played it back
Buttons on a coat
Light hearted joke
No proof not much
But you saw enough
Small talk, he drives
Coffee at midnight, the light reflects
The chain on your neck
He says look up
And your shoulders brush
No proof, one touch
You felt enoughYou can hear it in the silence, silence, you
You can feel it on the way home, way home, you
You can see it with the lights out, lights out,
You are in love, true love
You are in loveMorning, his place
Burnt toast, Sunday
You keep his shirt
He keeps his word
And for once you let go
Of your fears and your ghosts
One step, not much, but it said enough
You kissed on sidewalks
You fight and you talk
One night he wakes, strange look on his face
Pauses, then says, you're my best friend
And you knew what it was, he is in loveYou can hear it in the silence, silence, you
You can feel it on the way home, way home, you
You can see it with the lights out, lights out
You are in love, true loveSo it goes
You two are dancing in a snow globe, go round and round
And he keeps the picture of you in his office downtown
You understand now why they lost their minds and fought the wars
And why I've spent my whole life try to put it into words'Cause you can hear in the silence
You can feel it on the way home
You can see it with the lights out
You are in love, true love
You're in loveYou can hear it in the silence, silence, you
You can feel it on the way home, way home, you
You can see it with the lights out, lights out
You are in love, true love
You're in love
You can hear it in the silence, silence, you
You can feel it on the way home, way home, you
You can see it with the lights out, lights out
You are in love, true love
You're in love 
It's strange to think the songs we used to sing
The smiles, the flowers, everything: is gone
Yesterday I found out about you
Even now just looking at you: feels wrong
You say that you'd take it all back, given one chance
It was a moment of weakness and you said yes...[Chorus:]You should've said no, you should've gone home
You should've thought twice before you let it all go
You should've know that word, bout what you did with her
Would get back to me...
And I should've been there, in the back of your mind
I shouldn't be asking myself why
You shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet...
You should've said no, baby and you might still have meYou can see that I've been crying
And baby you know all the right things: to say
But do you honestly expect me to believe
We could ever be the same...
You say that the past is the past, you need one chance
It was a moment of weakness and you said yes...[Repeat Chorus]I can't resist... before you go, tell me this
Was it worth it...
Was she worth this...No... no no no...[Repeat Chorus] 
You wake up, it's raining and it's Monday
Looks like one of those rough days
Time's up, you're late again, so get out the door
Sometimes you feel like running
Find a whole new life and jump in
Let go, get up and hit the dance floor
But when the lights go down it's the ending of the show
And you're feeling like you've got nowhere to go
Don't you know?You can change your hair and you can change your clothes
You can change your mind, that's just the way it goes
You can say goodbye and you can say hello
But you'll always find your way back home
You can change your style, you can change your jeans
You can learn to fly and you can chase your dreams
You can laugh and cry but everybody knows
You'll always find your way back homeYour best friends, your little hometown
Are waiting up wherever you go now
You know that you can always turn around
Cause this world is big and it's crazy
And this girl is thinking that maybe
This life is what some people dream about
Cause when I'm feeling down and I'm all alone
I've always got a place where I can go
Cause I knowYou can change your hair and you can change your clothes
You can change your mind, that's just the way it goes
You can say goodbye and you can say hello
But you'll always find your way back home
You can change your style, you can change your jeans
You can learn to fly and you can chase your dreams
You can laugh and cry but everybody knows
You'll always find your way back homeWhere they know exactly who you are
Where the real you is the superstar
You know it's never too far awayYou can change your hair and you can change your clothes
You can change your mind, that's just the way it goes
You can say goodbye and you can say hello
But you'll always find your way back
You can change your hair and you can change your clothes
You can change your mind, that's just the way it goes
You can say goodbye, you can say hello
But you'll always find your way back home
You can change your style, you can change your jeans
You can learn to fly and you can chase your dreams
You can laugh and cry but everybody knows
You'll always find your way back home
You'll always find your way back home
You'll always find your way back home 
Your Guardian AngelWhen I see your smile
Tears run down my face I can't replace
And now that I'm stronger I've figured out
How this world turns cold and breaks through my soul
And I know I'll find deep inside me I can be the oneI will never let you fall
I'll stand up with you forever
I'll be there for you through it all
Even if saving you sends me to heavenIt's ok. It's ok. It's ok.
Seasons are changing
And waves are crashing
And stars are falling all for us
Days grow longer and nights grow shorter
I can show you I'll be the oneI will never let you fall
I'll stand up with you forever
I'll be there for you through it all
Even if saving you sends me to heavenCuz you're my, you're my, my true love, my whole heart
Please don't throw that away
Cuz I'm here for you
Please don't walk away,
Please tell me you'll stay, stayUse me as you will
Pull my strings just for a thrill
And I know I'll be ok
Though my skies are turning grayI will never let you fall
I'll stand up with you forever
I'll be there for you through it all
Even if saving you sends me to heaven
