me and my baby
we drank some magic tea
we're crusing down the rural roads
aesthetics of povertyi'm going down for the last time
i shifted to my level
can you receive what you give me
somebody should set you freein the morning
when you wash your hair
i love those simple things that
make me know your therecome every sunday evening
it's leftovers from the weekenders
lost limbs to identify
frustration for the grieving 
From the bowery to the brimstone
I tried to find your heart
With drugs of initiation
The bottom of a barrel that drops
I understand your causes
Sympathize the motivation
But all the details of this war
Are just self-infatuationAnd it's one, two, three, nothing's for free
Four, five, six, pick up the sticks and go home
You better own up to me, yeahThe manic blood runs thick
My friend, are you looking for a clean escape?
What's left, when the locks have all been broken
Young children of authority
Now how long can you be agile dancing between the alter
And the mercy seat?
Yeah, now here's a chance to make a choice
Are you aware of the fire beneath your feet?One, two, three, nothing's for free
Four, five, six, pick up the sticks and go home
You better own up to me, yeah
Yeah yeah, go homeThe basement lies within us
Our fear comes through the door
Now there's nothing left between us
As the fear becomes a roarOnce that wheel is in motion
Don't lose what you have found
I'm talking about that burning wheel of tongues
Everything that makes it go round and round
We're all born in the devil's scorn
They want to see you die
I'm asking you, "Are you true?"
And everything they say is a lie, it's a lieOne, two, three, nothings for free
Four, five, six, pick up the sticks and goOne, two, three, nothings for free
Four, five, six, pick up the sticks and goOne, two, three, nothings for free
(We're all born in the devil's scorn)
One, two, three, nothings for free
(We're all born in the devil's scorn)
Everything they say it's a lie, it's a lie now
(We're all born in the devil's scorn)
Everything they say it's a lie, it's a lie now
(We're all born in the devil's scorn)Pick up the sticks
(Pick up the sticks)
Pick up the sticks
(Pick up the sticks)
Pick up the sticks
(Pick up the sticks)
Pick up the sticks
Go home 
New york
To your tall skyline I come
Flying in from london
To your doorNew york
Lookin' down on central park
Where they say you should not wander
After darkNew york
Like a scene from all those movies
But you're real enough to me
But there's a heart
A heart that lives in new yorkA heart in new york
A rose on the street
I write my song to that city heartbeat
A heart in new york
Love in her eye
An open door and a friend for the nightNew york
You got money on your mind
And my words don't make a dime's
Worth a difference
So here's to you new yorkNew york
Now my plane is touching down 
I went to a wedding, I brought a song
I folded it up like a list of thanks at a Praisathon
The bride was Snow White, the groom was strong
Trailers as endless as the day is long
Some days are fairy tales, some days belie
The four and twenty black birds baked in a pie
Could open up their sweet throats to serenade a king
That's a lot of heat to take and still be able to sing, sing, sing
It's not been proven hard to bring unending start
And even easier to die from a broken heart
Oh, was a blind force trauma from the fireworks
That someone is celebrating while another gets hurt
Some days are fairy tales, some days belie
The four and twenty black birds baked in a pie
Could open up their sweet throats to serenade a king
That's a lot of heat to take and still be able to sing
Still I see them in the night
With their blood red wings alike
While the rocket's red glare
Gives proof through the night
If some things not right
Some things not right
In the book of Steven there is no prophecy
'Cause there was no need for God in the way things came to be
Some live by faith, some live by proof
They don't meet up on a friendly road or live under the same roof
Some days are fairy tales, some days belie
Four and twenty black birds baked in a pie
Could open up their sweet throats to serenade a king
That's a lot of heat to take and still be able to sing, sing, sing
Sing, sing, sing
And the birds fall hard like black rain
Jerking the earth with a portent stain
Beat like drums, they beat like a wings
Are we looking? Are we listening?
Sing, sing, sing, sing
Sing, sing, sing 
Up on the airplane
Nearer my God to thee
I start making a deal
Inspired by gravity
(Inspired by gravity)If I did wrong I won't do it again
(Ooh)
'Cause I can be sweet and good and nice
And if I had enemies their friends
(Pap paa)
I'll hold to my life with the grip of a vice
(Pap paa, pap paa)And I'm up on the airplane
(Up on the airplane)
Nearer my God to thee
(Nearer my God)
(Nearer my God to thee)
I start making a deal
(Up on my [Incomprehensible])
Inspired by gravity
(Inspired by gravity)That little spot on the ground is my hometown
(On the ground, my hometown)
I like to call it my home and it's sweet
I'd rather take a seat down there
(Pap paa)
Than a throne up here up above thirty thousand feet
(Pap paa, pap paa)And I'm up on the airplaneI never should have read my horoscope
Or the fortune on the bubble gum strip
Saying what you think won't happen will
Great thing to read before a trip
On an airplane
(Eee)Pilot says the big blue sky's like a swimmin' pool
Big fluffy clouds like a feather bed
I'd rather have a real pillow underneath my head
(Pap pa paa, pap pa paa)
Lyin' in my bed which is in my hometown
(Pap pa paa)
Which is on the groundFar from an airplane
(My bed, my hometown)
Far from an airplane
(On the ground my bed, my hometown)
Far from an airplane
(On the ground my bed, my hometown)
On the airplane
(On the ground)Far from an airplane
(My bed, my hometown)
Far from an airplane

Ooh
Ooh
OohDust in our eyes our own boots kicked up
Heartsick we nursed along the way we picked up
You may not see it when it's sticking to your skin
But we're better off for all that we let inWe've lost friends and loved ones much too young
There were so much promise and work left undone
When all that guards us is a single center line
And the brutal crossing over when it's timeOoh
(Well, I don't know where it all begins)
Ooh
(And I don't know where it all will end)
Ooh
(We're better off for all that we let in)One day those toughies will be withered up and bent
The father-son, the holy warriors and the President
With glory days of put up dukes for all the world to see
Beaten into submission in the name of the freeWe're in an evolution, I have heard it said
And everyone's so busy now but do we move ahead
The planets hurling and atoms splitting
And a sweater for your love you sit there knittingOoh
(Well, I don't know where it all begins)
Ooh
(And I don't know where it all will end)
Ooh
(We're better off for all that we let in)See those crosses on the side of the road
Tied with ribbons in the medium
They make me grateful, I can go this far
Lay me down and never wake me up againKat writes a poem and she sticks it on my truck
We don't believe in war and we don't believe in luck
The birds were calling to her, what were they saying
As the gate blew open in the tops of the trees were swayingI've passed the cemetery, walk my dog down there
I read the names in stone and say a silent prayer
When I get home, you're cooking supper on the stove
And the greatest gift of life is to know loveOoh
(Well, I don't know where it all begins)
Ooh
(And I don't know where it all will end)
Ooh
(We're better off for all that we let in) 
I wasn't looking to shift my direction
My eyes straight ahead, hands ten and two
The gravity of our first connection
Veering off the road and into youAnd all the people drive by slowly gawking at the scene
Of the smoldering inevitable spark and gasolineAll the way, I met you head on full speed
At the heart the blue flame burns
All the way, I took the crash course impact
But have I learned all that I'm supposed to learn?No amount of playing safe could save me from this day
The heed seeking path of my trajectory
Didn't we coolly divest of predestination
Slamming into futures we can't see?And I know what can happen when there's more than meets the eye
But there's no way to avoid it, just get in the car and driveAll the way, I met you head on full speed
At the heart the blue flame burns
All the way, I took the crash course impact
But have I learned all that I'm supposed to learn?It makes me laugh, we're talking over tea
(I know what I should do)
When I can still smell the smoke on our sleeve
(I don't wanna do it)Steaming like gun smoke, the wreckage of our past
(I would make it way out)
And the scene of a crime I still can't leave
(But I can't get to it)Oh, you and me, we should let well enough be
But each revisitation points to clues
There's the oil slick of uncertainty
And warning signs back there we didn't useAt least we laugh about it now how we escaped alive
It's remarkable the mess we make and what we can surviveAll the way, I met you head on full speed
At the heart the blue flame burns
All the way, I took the crash course impact
But have I learned all that I'm supposed to learn? 
"Always Be There" is an Amy Ray song from "Color Me Grey."
Always Be There.
It was you who walked into my life
You were the one - you hear my cries of loneliness
Through my cool, cautious eyes
Can't you see me reaching out for you?
Can't you feel me there?
Won't you please believe me?
I could never touch you for the fear that I might never let you go.
It was you, with the courage and the commitment
To start your new life
You make me believe in mine
But can't you see the confusion through my troubled smile?
I'm torn between losing me
Losing me and gaining you.
Maybe I've been distant
Maybe I've been cold
But I've done it for my own existence
And I do believe - I do believe it's getting old.
I might never say that I love you
I might never say I care
But I will tell you now
I'll always be there 
"American Tune" is a Paul Simon song. The girls have been performing
it since at least 1985. A live version of it appears on the
(promo-only) "Reverse 1" CD, and another on the (commercially
available, but kinda hard to find) "Ben and Jerry's Newport Folk
Festival '90" CD.
Many is the time I've been mistaken
And many times confused
Yes, and I've often felt forsaken
And certainly misused.
Oh, but I'm all right, I'm all right
I'm just weary to my bones
Still, you don't expect to be bright and bon vivant
So far away from home - so far away from home.
I don't know a soul who's not been battered
I don't have a friend who feels at ease
I don't know a dream that's not been shattered
Or driven to it's knees
Oh, but it's all right, it's all right
We've lived so well, so long
Still, when I think of the road we're travelling on
I wonder what's gone wrong
I can't help it, I wonder what's gone wrong.
And I dreamed I was dying
Dreamed that my soul rose unexpectedly
And looking back down at me
Smiled reassuringly
And I dreamed I was flying
And high up above, my eyes could clearly see
The Statue of Liberty sailing away to sea
And I dreamed I was dying.
Oh, we come on a ship they called the Mayflower
We come on a ship that sailed the moon
We come in the age's most uncertain hour
And sing an American tune
Oh, oh, but it's all right - it's all right, it's all right
You can't be forever blessed
Still, tomorrow's going to be another working day
And I'm trying to get some rest
That's all I'm trying - to get some rest 
Andy, do you love me?
Do you think about it? Will you say?
Turning brushwood into blazes
Turning summer grass into hay
Turning sharply past the graveyard
To the lakefront
With the black waves licking up the stones
To the swayed back screened in front porch
Who could ever stay the weight
Of flesh and bonesAndy, aren't you tired?
From the sun and rain, river soaking you
From the beer cans on your dashboard
And the bullet hole glass spiderweb
Staining your rear view
I have watched you watch an empty road
Is it only her upon which
All of you is depending
To fill your twenty hour work day
While all the fences In this county still need mending, heyAnd in the night I do my checking
Fix the broken parts with visions of rare beauty
But in my heart I know I'm second
Forever fixed in your pursuit
It is my duty, heyAndy, will you toss me?
A little scrap of something that I can taste
Instead of dust from all the leaving
And the smell of summer lying here to waste
Under the burnt pyre of all the castaway
Tiny shoots will spring like questions
Will you take me?
Out to the fenced hill sprinkled with horses
Wild in resistence to the taming
Will you break me? Will you break me? 
Angels we have heard on high
Sweetly singing o'er the plains
And the mountains in reply
Echoing their joyous strainsGloria, in excelsis Deo
Gloria, in excelsis DeoShepherds, why this jubilee?
Why your joyous strains prolong?
What the gladsome tidings be
Which inspire your heavenly song?Gloria, in excelsis Deo
Gloria, in excelsis DeoCome to Bethlehem and see
In whose birth the angels sing
Come, adore on bended knee
Christ the Lord, the newborn KingGloria, in excelsis Deo
Gloria, in excelsis DeoSee Him in a manger laid
Whom the choirs of angels praise
Mary, Joseph, lend your aid
While our hearts in love we raiseGloria, in excelsis Deo
Gloria, in excelsis Deo 
I was taken by surprise
I was haunted by his eyes
And the drink I came her for
Doesn't matter anymore
And the night wind falls
With the moonlight from above
Is it winter is it summer or is it loveAnd it's probably cold outside
But I don't really feel it no
Every hour that passes by
Is another heart healer
And you can't stop the rain from falling down
On the new leaves of summer on the ground
And for every bright star that falls from the sky
There's another
Oh another on the riseI've been broken
I've been blind
Been afraid to look inside
But his words were soft and warm
What did I come her for
An abandoned garden lost
In bittersweet and queen anne's lace
Looked inside where a single rose grew
There I saw love's faceAnd it's probably cold outside
But I don't really feel it
Every hour that passes by
Is another heart healer
And you can't stop the rain from falling down
On the new leaves of summer on the ground
And for every bright star that falls from the sky
There's another
Oh another on the rise 
"Anyone But Myself" is an Amy Ray song from "Color Me Grey."
Anyone But Myself.
If you ever feel you'll lose your dreams
Or your hope seems too far on
I'll bring the distance to your door
You couldn't ask for any more
You were around when I needed a friend
You were the means, you were the end
You'll be the one I turn to now
Gonna be some hard times coming down
Without you, the world would be so crowded
Without you, the moon would be so clouded
Without you, I can be anyone
Anyone at all - but myself
If ever your candle won't blow out
Or your sorrow seems so interrupted
Well, I'll be the first to bring darkness down
I'll be the silence at your side
Without you, the music couldn't move me
The words would ring true, but the tune would seem so empty
Without you, I can be anyone
Anyone at all - but myself
But myself
Wish I was a slow moving sea
Moving away from the land so cautiously
I'd find me an island to surround
Just like you did as I was feeling down
As I was feeling down
Without you, the world would be so crowded
Without you, the moon would be so clouded
Without you, I can be anyone
Anyone at all - but myself
Wish I was a slow moving sea
Wish I was a slow moving sea
Love is like a slow moving sea
Keeping in touch with eternity
Wish I was a slow, slow, slow, slow moving sea
Love is like a slow moving sea... 
Anyway, I Love You.
Sweet Gypsy, blowing through my mind
And through my heart, so full and empty
Well, these days seem strange somehow
A billion years isn't what it appears to be.
Now you tell me that you're losing hold of time
You can't seem to find your peace of mind
Well, I'm so far away, and I'm trying to see you through
I can't help but feel I may be losing you.
Should I let you go
For your own sake?
Should I hold you close
For mine?
Anyway, I love you, and I couldn't be more sure
These tears cry out "Please, don't let go,"
Oh, but their words
They keep haunting me.
You can't build your life around a dream
Well, it's too late
Now, my world is you
There's nothing they could say or do.
Well, I remember the first time that I fell
I swear I never thought I'd make it up again
I've been flying on the wings of your love
And I'm not getting down, just to fall again.
Don't it seem like the road is, oh, so long?
Well, everybody's moving out
And we're staying on
In this absurdity.
Now you don't let go of me
I'm begging you
Now, you don't let go of me.
Anyway, I love you. 
Leavin' ain't fair, you know
Partin' ain't just, people got to move on
People got to do what they mustAnd we're back together again
And I'm never gonna lose you as a friendGrowin' up free, growin' up wild
If you wanna know the secret behind the smile
You got to ask a Tuesday's childAnd we're back together again
And I'm never gonna lose you as a friendWell, I guess that highway got a hold of me
Thinkin' crazy thoughts like it was gonna set me freeThis ain't my place, you know
This ain't my home and I'm not gonna feel right
'Til you get us back behind the microphonesAnd we're back together again
And I'm never gonna lose you as a friend
No, I'm never gonna lose you as a friend
No, I'm never gonna lose you as a friend 
I'm just a bartender
I don't like my work
I don't mind the money at all
I see lots of sad faces
And lots of bad cases
Of folks with their backs to the wallI need four walls around me to hold my life
To keep me from going astray
A honky-tonk angel to hold me tight
To keep me from slipping awayI can light up your smokes
And I'll laugh at your jokes
And I'll watch you fall down on your knees
Close down this bar
Gas up my car
Pack up and mail in my keyI need four walls around me to hold my life
To keep me from going a-stray
A honky-tonk angel to hold me tight
To keep me from slipping awayThe smoke fills the air
In this honky-tonk bar
And I'm thinking about where I'd rather be
Yeah
But I sunk all my bridges
I burned all my boats
I'm stranded at the edge of the sea
YeahI need four walls around me to hold my life
To keep me from going astray
A honky-tonk angel to hold me tight
To keep me from slipping awayI need four walls around me to hold my life
To keep me from going astray
A honky-tonk angel to hold me tight
To keep me from slipping away 
Beauty Queen Sister
-Amy RayEverybody loves the beauty queen sister
But she always got the broken heart
'Cause she work hard to keep what God gave her
But the devil he's just pulling it apart
Hang on tight
Hang on tight now
Mama's got a friend name Monkeyman
With a two-seater bike
And a tattoo stand
He's gonna take me for that ride
He knows I've been losing ground most of my life
Hang on tight
Hang on tight now
Daddy prayed so hard
That Jesus came down and took him
Left me speaking in tongues
And hungry for something
So I fed the family, I changed out the sparks
But every day I gained, another fell apart
Hang on tight now
Hey little sister, I dig it okay
Looking for the fountain of love
Where the wild heart riegns
And the knife draws blood
And beauty is redeemed
But Cherry and Dallas won't ever be the same
Pony watched Johnny die
nothing gold can stay*
And those street kids and beauty queens
They don't stand a chance
So hang on tight...
Monkeyman says draw your picture
Give it some ink, hear the needle whisper
For all the broken hearts and the passing fancies
Pull the inside out, when you can
Hang on tight
Hang on tight now 
Beauty to Disaster.
I cried the night you left me
I never cried so hard
I never felt so helpless
Except the night that we made love
From beauty to disaster
I held you in my arms
Long enough to reach around you
To keep my fingers warm
Through egos, bars, and pills
You kept me in my place
You saved me from this spotlight
Well, I guess I'm living in disgrace
From beauty to disaster
I held you in my arms
Long enough to reach around you
To keep my fingers warm
I wonder, how is California?
Is it the blonde-haired, blue-eyed life?
Is it okay for me to ask you
Do you have a husband or a wife?
From beauty to disaster
I never cried so hard
I never felt so helpless
I cried with all my might 
I heard you sing a rebel song
Sung it loud and all alone
We can't afford the things you save
We can't afford the warrantyWell I see you walking in the glare
Down the county road we share
Our southern blood my heresy
Damn that ol' confederacyIt took a, long time to
Become the thing, I am to you
And you won't, tear it apart
Without a fight, without a heartI'm sorry for what you've learned
When you feel the tables turn
To run so hard in your race
Now you found who set the paceThe landed aristocracy
Exploiting all your enmity
All your daddies fought in vain
Leave you with the mark of CainIt took a, long time to
Become the thing, I am to you
And you won't, tear it apart
Without a fight, without a heartIt took a, long time to
Become you, become youThe center holds so they say
(It never held too well for me)
It never held too well for me
(The center holds so they say)
I won't stop short for common ground
(That vilifies the trodden down)
That vilifies the trodden down
(I won't stop)The center held the bonded slave
For the sake of industry
The center held the bloody hand
Of the executioner manIt took a, long time to
Become the thing, I am to you
And you won't, tear it apart
Without a fight, without a heartIt took a
Long time to
Become you
Become youIt took a
Long time to
Become you
Become you 
I couldn't think of a thing to write
On your birthday card
Considered the poets
But they didn't know what
Lay quite inside my heart
I thought of Atlanta
I thought of Toronoto
And all of the places we've been
I filled up my tea and looked into the trees
And still came up empty again
So I guess the next time you see me
In a world of partial truths
You will fully believe me
I have nothing to give except but to live
Like the person you know me to be
I can clean up the kitchen
And fold up your clothes
Neatley as I am able
Wrap a box up with ties for a surprise
And order you flowers for the table
I could book us a trip
On a plane or ship
I know how much you love the sun
You could gamble on me
Like the lottery
And I'll make you feel like you've won
And I'll bet the next time you see me
In a world of partial truths
You will fully believe me
I have nothing to give except but to live
Like the person you know me to be
Life is short and so on
I'd like to give you something to go on
Grow on
They recently paved the walk on our street
We looked at the shiny cement
We stopped the car ready to carve
Our names into permanence
For a moment we're kids
Intent on a whim
There is no shadowy past
But even so the urge is to go
And put something down
That will last
So here goes
The next time I show up for you
You will know
And believe
I am ready to give
Ready to live
Like the person you know me to be. 
When I'm out walking
I strut my stuff
And I'm so strung outI'm high as a kite

Well I have spent nights with matches and knives
Leaning over ledges only two flights up
Hurting my heart, burning my soul nothing left to hold
Nothing left the blood and the fire
You have spent nights thinking of me
Missing my arms but you needed to leave
Leaving my cuts, leaving my burns, hoping I'd learnBut blood and fire are too much for
These restless arms to hold
And my nights of desire
They're calling me back to your fold
And I am calling you, calling you
From ten thousand miles away
Won't you whet my fire with your love, babe?I am looking for someone who can
Take as much as I give babe
And give back as much as I need you know
And they, they still have the will to live
'Cause I am intense, I am in need
I am in pain, I am in love, but I feel forsaken
You know like the things I, I gave awayAnd blood and fire are too much for these
Restless arms to hold
And my nights of desire
They're calling me back to your fold
And I am callin' you, callin' you
From ten thousand miles away
Would you whet my fire with your love?
And it's babe, babe, babeI am intense, I am in need
I am in pain, I am in love
You know and I am intense, I am in need
I am in pain, I am in love
I am intense, I am in need
I am in pain, I am in loveAnd blood and fire are too much for
These restless arms to hold
And my nights of desire
They're callin' me back to your fold
And I am callin' you, callin' you
From ten thousand miles away
Won't you whet my fire with your love, babe?
Won't you whet my fire with your love, babe now?
Whet my fire with your love 
You're standing in the blood quantum line
With a pitcher in your hand
Poured from your heart into your veins
You said I am

I am sorry that I set my sights
On the things I read
Something meant for your husband
And maybe, you left it under the bedOnce upon a love those words blew free and secret
The pages layin' around
Drifted to the hands of the publisher

Hung out house soaked souls out on the line

Caramia
Blank notebook and a back pocket fade
You used to mock me
Sometimes I would cry
When I was home later
'Cause you hurt my feelings
Why? Why? Why?
(Why? Why? Why?)
You said write it down in your notebook
And I wanna be Harriet the spy
And some say your genius
Is in your madness
Will you get better
(Will you get better)
And then will you leave us
(Will you leave us)
How you mixed with the darkness
At such a young age
(Until in your chemistry)
Until in your chemistry
(Silence and violence)
Silence and violence
(Silence and violence)
Turned silence to rage
AhhWhy are you dreamin' this
One shoe off
And a bridge to cross over
And where is your taxi fare?
Are you left by yourself
Or left by your lover?
(Are you left by your lover?)
For three nights straight now
I dream, I kept both of my shoes
But I've forgotten my lines
And I've misplaced my cues
And there's a sea full of faces
And a show to go on
But I'm struck mute at entrance
With nothing to draw fromThere were the secrets
The big bang and the bigger joke
You seem to know all of them
That's why injustice makes you red with choke
Yeah, but you love like you're desperate
You don't know what love is
(If there was one thing)
And I thought if there was one thing I could give you
One thing I could give you
(If there was one thing)
Well maybe it was this
The head on the bed board
(Sadness)
The anguished repeat
(Sadness)
The sweat of our sadness
(Sweat of our sadness)
And the twist of the sheets
(Twist of the sheets)
I don't want whats best for you
Where will I be when you've found it
(Where will I, where will I)
You know I pray a lot about these bad feelings inside
(Where will I, where will I be)
I can't pray my way through or around itHey
Why are you dreamin' this
One shoe off
And a bridge to cross over
(And a bridge to cross over)
And where is your taxi fare
Are you left by yourself
(Are you left)
Or left by your lover?
(By yourself)
For three nights straight now
(Left by your lover)
You know I keep both of my shoes
(I've got bad feelings inside)
But I've forgotten my lines
(I can't pray through)
I've misplaced my cues
(I can't pray my way around it)
And there's a sea full of faces
And a show to go on
I'm struck mute at entrance
With nothing to draw from
Nothing to draw from 
In my mind I'm going to carolina
Can't you see the sunshine
Can't you just feel the moon shining
Ain't it just like a friend of mine
It hit me from behind
And I'm going to carolina in my mindKaren she's a silver sun
You best walk her way and watch it shining
Watch her watch the morning come
A silver tear appearing now I'm crying ain't i
I'm going to carolina in my mindThere ain't no doubt it no ones mind
That loves the finest thing around
Whisper something soft and kind
Hey babe the sky's on fire I'm dying well ain't i
I'm going to carolina in my mindIn my mind I'm going to carolina
Can't you see the sunshine
Can't you just feel the moon shining
Ain't it just like a friend of mine
To hit me from behind
And I'm going to carolina in my mindDark and silent late last night
I think I might have heard the highway calling
Geese in flight and dogs that bite
Signs that might be omens say I going going
I'm going to carolina in my mind
Now with a holy host of others standing round me
Still I'm on the dark side of the moon
And it seems like it goes on like this forever
You must forgive me
If I'm up and going to carolina in my mindIn my mind I'm going to carolina
Can't you see the sunshine
Can't you just feel the moon shining
Ain't it just like a friend of mine
To hit me from behind
And I'm going to carolina in my mind
Going to carolina in my mind
Going to carolina in my mind 
Carry Me Away.
I called you up today to breach my sorrow
Carry me over the line to you
How long will it take to reach tomorrow
Seems like a whole lot of time
With just these thoughts to pull me through
I see blue carpet and cold moonlight settle in
Voices whisper down the hallway of how I should have been
I feel like I'm over the water, but I'm caught in the tide
Tell me, are you calling for me?
Does this come deep from inside?
Carry me away, under the water, over the line
Carry me away, under the water, over the line
The sound slowly fades and trickles away from the scene
It's only the windows of life
They hear my dreams
Walking the distance, I feel like I've been running for miles
Happy times don't last long
I finally got there and it's too late to smile
Carry me away, under the water, over the line
Carry me away, under the water, over the line
Carry me away, under the water, into your mind. 
You dug a well
You dug it deep
For every wife you buried
And planted a Cedar tree
The best
The best you ever hadI stand where you stood
I stand for bad or good
And I am green
And you are wood
The best
The best he ever hadI dig a well
I dig it deep
And for my only love
I plant a Cedar tree
The best
The best we ever had 
Laughing in a crown of jewels
Numbness from a scepters wound
Toss and turn, I spin and learn
Catch yourself before you burnJoker's dance before the king
Jangling beads and silver rings
Close your eyes and bare the sound
Jumpin' up, fallin' downFallin', fallin', fallin', fallin' down
Look yourself in the eye before you drownRoyal rebels discover you
The trust you turn, there is no truth
And circle, circle, why are you scared?
Why a smile instead of tearsI'm gulping smoke I fade away
Figures floatin' down to lay
I meet the joker and the thief
King and Queen but, no reliefFallin', fallin', fallin', fallin' down
(The king is in the counting house)
(Counting all his money)
Look yourself in the eye before you drown
(The queen is in her parlor)
(Eating bread and honey)Fallin', fallin', fallin', fallin' down
(The king is in the counting house)
(Counting all his money)
Look yourself in the eye before you drown
(The queen is in her parlor)
(Eating bread and honey)I cross myself before I die
And the leapin' man, he asks me, why?
Well your rhythm is off, I reply
Now you must dance the dance, that you implyYour actions will follow you full circle round
Your actions will follow you full circle round
Your actions will follow you full circle round
(Your actions will follow you full circle round)
Your actions will follow you full circle round
(Your actions will follow you full circle round)
Your actions will follow you full circle round
(Your actions will follow you full circle round)
Your actions will follow you full circle round
(Round, round, round, round)
Your actions will follow you full circle round
(Round, round, round, round)
The higher the leap, I said
The harder the ground 
All the girls with anorexia are on the street tonight
And the boys in the band think they look just fine
And I don't even know why I drove this car down congress avenue
Hoping to find you turning on the lightWell you seem like a girl with the world on your side
But it's just a point of view
And you know how quickly that could change too
See I heard you were free or someone thinks you should be
And I know just how that feels
I thought maybe we could just talk for a whileCause baby I got something to stand for
I got somewhere we could go home
I just need someone to stand with
See it ain't no good this feeling aloneWhen you said that you'd go down to mexico
Well I think that I might go there too
But it's probably too late to find someone like you
Yeah it sounds really cool to be without a care in some southern town
But I heard there's trouble down there if you're chiapas bound 
I am an only child
Born of the wild
Riddled to spend my time
Defending my land
You are the only one
Born in the sun
Riddled to spend your time
Defending my planDead dog on the highway
Median cats are growling at me
I turn my lights on brighter
I'm counting through the night rideAnd it's one more life
(For the taker)
Chickenman, chickenman
One more song
(For the maker)
Chickenman, chickenmanOn the road to Athens
I saw a dead deer on the highway
I slipped into a desert
Five prairie dogs and a rabbitI was running down on Queen Street
I saw a woman on the sidewalk
(Danger danger)
She was beaten by a stranger
(Danger danger danger danger)
Danger danger dangerAnd it's one more life
(For the taker)
Chickenman, chickenman
Chickenman hold my hand
One more song
(For the maker)
Hold my hand
ChickenmanI was on the road to Austin
Met a man on the highway
He sold me junk and conversation
He was wise and dirty from the weatherI said, "Darkness into darkness
All the carnage of my journeys
Makes it harder to be living"
He said, "It's a long road to be forgiven"It's one more life
(For the taker)
Chickenman, chickenman

Chickenman, chickenman

Born of the wild
Riddled to spend my time

Born in the sun
Riddled to spend your time

Found myself beneath the stars
I went looking for a girl
Found a man and his world
Chickenman, chickenman

It was christmastime in washington
The democrats rehearsed
Gettin' into gear for four more years
Of things not gettin' worseThe republicans drank whiskey neat
And they thanked their lucky stars
They said "he can not seek another term
They'll be no more f.d.r.s"I sat home in tennessee
Just starin' at the screen
An uneasy feelin' in my chest
Just wonderin' what it meansSo come back woody guthrie
Come back to us now
Tear your eyes from paradise
And rise again somehow
If you run into jesus
Maybe he can help us out
Come back woody guthrie
To us nowI followed in your footsteps once
Back in my travelin' days
Somewhere I failed to find your trail
Now I'm stumblin' through the hazeThere's killers on the highway now
And a man can't get around
So I just sold my soul for wheels that roll
Now I'm stuck here in this townSo come back woody guthrie
Come back to us now
Tear your eyes from paradise
And rise again somehow
If you run into jesus
Maybe he can help us out
Come back woody guthrie
To us nowSee there's foxes in the henhouse
And there's cows out in the corn
The unions have been busted
And their proud red banners tornBut if you listen to the radio
They'll tell you all is well
But you and me and cisco know
It's goin' straight to hellSo come back emma goldman
Rise up old joe hill
The barricades are goin' up
They cannot break our will
Come back to us malcolm x
And martin luther king
We're marchin' into selma
While the bells of freedom ringAnd come back woody guthrie
Come back to us now
Tear your eyes from paradise
And rise again somehow 
Taking off his turban, they said is this man a Jew
'Cause they're working for the clampdown
And they put up a poster saying
We earn more than you when we're working for the clampdown
We will teach our twisted speech
To the young believers
Train our blue-eyed men
To be young believersJudge said five to ten I said, double that again
I'm not working for the clampdown
Well, no one born with a living soul
Could be working for the clampdown
Kick over the wall, 'cause governments to fall
How can you refuse it?
Let fury have the hour, anger can be power
Don't you know that you can use itThe voices in your head are calling
Stop wasting your time, there's nothing coming
Only a fool would think someone could save youThe men at the factory are old and cunning
You don't owe nothing, so, boy, get running
It's the best years of your life they want to stealYou grow up and you calm down
'Cause you're working for the clampdown
And you start wearing the blue and the brown
'Cause you're working for the clampdown
So you got someone to boss around
Does it makes you feel big now?
And you drift until you brutalize
You've made your first kill nowI say, in these days of evil presidentes
Working for the clampdown
I said, lately one or two have fully paid their dues
Working for the clampdownWorking for the clampdown
Hey, you are now
Working for the clampdown
Hey, you are now (working for the clampdown)
Kick over the wall (working for the clampdown)
'Cause governments to fall (working for the clampdown)
How can you refuse it? (working for the clampdown)
Hey, get along now (working for the clampdown)
Giving away no secrets 
(They're on) those days when the sun barely touches the sky
Your eyes are so heavy with the morning
And there you lie on the horizon of my mind
Streams flow through the consciousness of time
And I follow every movement for a clue to you
You cover my eyes with your deepness
You wrap my soul in the beauty of it all
You take me away from my incompleteness
Lead me all the way, or not at all
And time's too precious here
I can't wait for clues to you
I can't wait for clues to you
Don't wake me if I'm dreaming, no, no, no, this is my reality
If I touch you now, tell me, will you blow away?
Please don't move now, until you set me free - set me free
I can't wait for clues to you
Name the time and I'll be your place
Remove my eyes from this deathly haze
Now, I've been living shades of blue and grey
Don't you know I'm ready for a brighter phase
And time's too precious here
I can't wait for clues to you
I can't wait for clues to you
Won't you catch me if I fall too fast
Don't let me fly too high
You've released me from my earthly grasp
And now you've got me in your skies - in your skies
I can't wait for clues to you
Now I don't want to wait anymore for clues
Let it rain
Let it wash on down
I can't wait for clues to you
I don't want to wait anymore for clues 
I don't think you understand
Oh, the rhythm of my heart
There's a strong line to mind and soul
I feel it tearing apartI've been searching for new words
Gonna make you understand in a different way
When I told you I'd hang on forever
I threw my choice awayAnd it's cold as ice
I can't let go
It's cold as ice
Baby but I, but I need your loveAnd I wish I could have been the first one
Oh, to walk out the door
The more I find myself to blame
The less there is to come back forYou wish you could have been the last one
To tell me how you really feel
'Cause when you closed the door, oh, deep inside
My heart it still seemed so sincereAnd it's cold as ice
I can't let go, oh
It's cold as ice
Baby but I, well, I need your loveIt's cold as ice
I can't let go
It's cold as ice
Baby but I, but I need your loveOne, two, three, fourIf there's a message to this madness
Well, it still seems quite unclear
If I really need to save myself
Why can't I just walk out of hereThere's a message in your eyes
And you make it perfectly plain
And either I leave your heart behind
Or crack beneath this freezing
Freezing, freezing, freezing rainCold as ice
I can't let go
Cold as ice
Baby but I, but I need your love
Oh, yes I doI said I'm cold, I'm cold
I'm cold, I'm cold, cold as ice
I can't let go
Oh no, I can't let go
No no, I'm cold as ice
But I'm cold as ice
But I can't let goOne, two, three, four 
All of my days have been misspent
Stuffing out the sofa and the antenna's bent
Inside my heart's busting out at the seams
I work for the impossible American dreamI got a job at the grocery store
A few bucks an hour and not much more
The world comes in just to take things away
They eat it all up and then they sleep into dayI try not to care, I would lose my mind
Running 'round the same things time after time
Only two things bound to soothe my soul
Cold beer and remote controlOnce upon a time I was nobody's fool
Two jobs and showing up for school
I guess it comes apart so little by little
You don't know you're there 'til you're stuck in the middleI try not to care, I would lose my mind
Running 'round the same things time after time
Only two things bound to soothe my soul
Cold beer and remote controlSit down, the room is dark
The blurry graffiti on the benches across at the public park
The plastic's black and buttoned
The haze is blue and all I want is nothing to do'Cause it's a long walk to the bus stop
It's a long wait for the turning clock
A two-tired car sitting up on the blocks
Things I put aside like that pile of rocksI try not to care, I would lose my mind
Running 'round the same things time after time
Only two things bound to soothe my soul
Cold beer and remote controlYes, I try not to care, I would lose my mind
(All of my days have been misspent)
Running 'round the same thing time after time
(Stuffing out the sofa and the antenna's bent)Only two things bound to soothe my soul
(Inside my heart's busting out at the seams)
Cold beer and remote control
(I work for the impossible American dream)Cold beer and remote control
(I guess it comes apart just a little by little, yeah)
(I guess it comes apart just a little by little, yeah)
Beer and remote control 
I could paint you in the dark
'Cause I've studied you with hunger
A work of art
These are very secret days
I collect my information
Then I stow it all awayCall me
When you breeze through
To your appointments
The work you do
Call me
I'm collecting youThe pleading prayer and hair shirt sting
My hair trigger love and faulty spring
Motivations smokes a name
I don't like that smile applied to me
So blindly just the sameCall me
When you breeze through
To your appointments
The work you do
Call me
I'm collecting youTurning up my collar
To an unseasonal chill
You ask a favor
You know I will
And the rain comes as surprise
We fly across the railroad ties
I feel the danger
The foolish thrill
Oh yes I willWhat it will or won't be then
The shutter predevelopment
And the ink full in the pen
Mind the minds-eye trickery
'Cause you might picture killer beautiful
Much more than it might beCall me
Tell me
What you're up to
What you do
Call me
I'm collecting youI would be foolish
To think that I
Could turn it off
And stay alive
The way I live
When you switch on
Hand on the dimmer
Give me just a glimmer
Give me just a shadow
Of hope around the edges
Agony and rapture
Forever uncapturedTake these secrets to your grave
Drug across your landscape
And bury in your cave
You're piling up and out of sight
Every try to add it up
Just feels like counting shades of lightCall me, yeah
Tell me
What you're up to
What you do
Call me
I'm collecting youHang it in my window
Let it complicate my view
The separation
The glass of you
But I can paint this picture
Any way that I see fit
The art of pain
The subject sits
Unmoved 
Her life is a show
One act follows the other everywhere she goes
She takes the leading role
She never plays herself, save for the time she's on the stage
Color her black or white
Now, either one reflects the teardrops
One extreme for the other
Nothing in between
Color her white for the princess she could be
Color her black for the troubled child she plays so well
Well, she's dancing through hell on a dream.
And blue is soul of the one
Reaching for the man that she hasn't got yet
And holding on to those hearts for lost causes
She could be so bright
But she's reaching for us all
Color her blue for the loneliness she feels
She's hiding her heart in the sky.
And this is a Thursday afternoon
It's just another Thursday afternoon
It's just another Thursday afternoon
Color me grey
I'm a little bit of everything today
And I'm not sure where I'm going
Color me grey
Wishing I was something more of distinction.
Color us all 'cause we're just stars
Wishing our lives away
Into the distance
And out of existence.
Color her black or white
Color her blue
Or color me grey
Color us all - we're stars
Wishing our lives away
Now we're stars 
I've come a long way
I was a show on ice
dazzling and brittle
but subject to the sun
And then one day
I went little by little
back to the water
the place where I'd come from
And I went under
like stones tied in a sack
and I got emptied
and started my way back
My name
it's got your name on it
my shame
it's got your name on it
my home
it's got your name on it
everything I own
and all my schemes drowned at the seams
have left me fine in my own skin
I've come a long way
just to begin
I've come a long way
under the cover of darkness
trusting a stranger
a boatman at the shore
the scourge of hope
the ugly face of danger
the keepers of the keys
had me down on my knees
in front of the gilded doors
and in a world where every ax was poised to grind
to find my peace I only held up what was already mine
my name
it's got your name on it
my shame
it's got your name on it
my home
it's got your name on it
everything I own
and all my swords have turned to words that blow like poems in the wind
I've come a long way
I used to be twisted
when you called it an opiate
a simple way to cope
and yet I think you shouldn't skip if you haven't worn the shoes
they start out tight
and then they hurt your tired feet at night
but then they give a little day by day
and then before you know it
you look back and you've come a long way
it's got your name on it
my shame
it's got your name on it
my home
it's got your name on it
everything I own
you call my name
my name
you call my name
my shame
you call my name
my home
everything I own
you call my name
if it's got my name, it's got your name on it
everything I own has got your name on it
when I was trying to cross the river
you were at the river getting me across and now
everything, everything I own
has got your name on it
oh everything
I've got your name on it 
In the quiet silent seconds i
I turned off the light switch and i
I came down to meet you in the
Half light the moon left while a
A cluster of night jars sang some
Songs out of tune
A mantle of bright light shone
Down from the roomCome down in time
I still hear him say
So clear in my ear
Like it was today
Come down in time
Was the message he gave
Come down in time and i'll
Meet you half wayWell I don't know if I should have
Heard him as yet but a
True love like his is a
A hard love to get and i've
Walked most all the way and i
I ain't heard him call and i'm
Getting to thinking
If he's coming at allCome down in time
I still hear him say
So clear in my ear
Like it was today
Come down in time
Was the message he gave
Come down in time and i'll
Meet you half way 
Dark clouds are coming in like an army
Soon the sky will open up and disarm me
You will go just like you've gone before
One sad soldier off to war with enemies that only you can seeDishes stacked, the table cleared
It's always like the scene of the last supper here
You speak so cryptically that's not news to me
The flood is here it will carry you
And I've got work to doCome on home, the team you're hitched to has a mind of its own
But it's just the forces of your past you've fought before
Come back here and shut the door
I'm stacking sandbags against the river of your troublesThere is fire there is lust
Some will trade it all for someone they could trust
There's a bag of silver for a box of nails
It's so simple the betrayal
Though it's known to change the world and what's to comeJust come on home, the team you're hitched to has a mind of its own
But it's just the forces of your past you've fought before
Don't you recognize them anymore
I'm stacking sandbags against the river of your troublesThere's the given and the expected
I count my blessings while I eye what I've neglected
Is this for better, is this for worse?
You're all jammed up and the dam's about to burst.I hear the owl in the night
I realize that some things never are made right
By some will we string together here
Days to months and months to years
What if everything we have adds up to nothingCome on home, the team you're hitched to has a mind of its own
But it's just the forces of your past you've fought before
Come back here and shut the door
I'm stacking sandbags against the river of your troubles 
You wear, the cloth, of finest lands
The touch of women the toil of hands
Undress, me now, before I bend
From the weight of everymanWhen I'm walkin' through this world
I need to hold your hand
Let me take you on this ride
I hope you understand
I'm not, not asking for a compromiseNow you, defend, exhume begin again
It's the riddle of a skeleton
We're all, diseased, so count the coup
I can't image stopping youWhen I'm walkin' through this world
I need to hold your hand
Ohh let me take you on this ride
I hope you understand
I'm not, not asking for a compromiseSo the earth, we scorch, we breath
Find some comfort on our knees
You find, your worth, in words that wind
Pleasures I don't comprehendWhen I'm walkin' through this world
I need to hold your hand
Let me take you on this ride
I hope you understand
I'm not asking for a compromise
Asking for a compro
Asking for a compromise 
The volunteers come for your prayers
And some souvenirs
With ivory skin and boycott lessons
Year after yearWell, I'm tracing your face up in the space of the bottom bunk
Oh Cordova
Where I cried and I cried
I knew I was trading on things that I didn't have
The things that I didn't haveNow you come to me
With revolution's infidelity
With blacklisted friends and Tupperware kin
And your big historyWell, I'm tracing your face up in the space of the bottom bunk
Oh Cordova
Where I cried and I cried
I knew I was trading on things that I didn't have
The things that I didn't haveI memorize the lullabies
Of dwindling lives
The lay of the land, the touch of each hand
We lose by and byI'm tracing your face up in the space of the bottom bunk
Oh Cordova
Where I cried and I cried
I knew I was trading on things that I didn't have
The things that I didn't have 
He came dancing across the water
With his galleons and guns
Looking for a new world
And a palace in the sunAnd on the shore lay montezuma
With it's coca leaves and pearls
In his halls he often wondered
With the secrets of the worldAnd the subjects gathered round him
Like the leaves around the trees
His coat of many colors
For the angry gods to seeAnd the women all were beautiful
And the men stood straight and strong
He offered life with sacrifice
So that others might go onYeahNow hate was just a legend
And war was never known
The people worked together
And they lifted many stonesAnd they carried them across the flatland
But they died along the way
(many lives were lost)
Built up with their bare hands
What we still can't do today
(many lives were lost)And I know she's living there
And loves me to this day
I can't remember when
Or how I lost my way
Ah-oh
Ah-oh
Ah-oh
Ah-ohHe came dancing across the water
Cortez, cortez
What a killer 
Take to the highway won't you lend me your name
Your way and my way seem to be one in the same
Momma don't understand it
She wants to know where I been
I'd have to be some kind of natural born fool
To want to pass that way again
But you know I could feel it
On a country roadSail on home to jesus won't you good girls and boys
I'm all in pieces, you can have your own choice
I could seen a heavenly band full of angels
And they're a comin' to set me free
Don't know much about the wild wind
But I can tell that it's bound to because I could feel it
On a country roadGuess my feet know where the want me to go
Walking on a country roadWalk on down, walk on down, walk on down
Walk on down, walk on down a country road yeah
La la la la la la la
Country road
Yeah walking on a country road
Country road
Yeah
Walking on a country road 
Hello cowgirl in the sand
Is this place at your command
Can I stay here for awhile
Can I see your sweet sweet smile
Old enough now to change your name
So many love you is it the same
It's the woman in you that makes you want to play this gameHello ruby in the dust
Has you band begun to rust
After all the sin we've had
I was hoping that we'd turn back
Old enough now to change your name
When so many love you is it the same
It's the woman in you that makes you want to play this gameHello woman of my dreams
You know it's not, it's not the way it seems
All these purple words on a grey background
To be a woman and to be turned down
Old enough now to change your name
So many love you is it the same
It's the woman in you that makes you want to play this game 
Crazy game
I never should have started to play
But now you couldn't tear me away
Love is sweet sweet baby
So good to you
So bad
And I fear
The situation's clear before my eyes
Confusion wants to break me and it tries
I've been a little bit stronger from the start
Listen to my heart'Cause if you're ever believing
I'm thinking of leaving
Look to the moon
'Cause it's a fact
She may go wandering about
But she always comes shining back
And it's true
I'll wait for youYou dry your tears
Don't be thinking grey is here to stay
Sometimes everything is in the way
You're wanting to look at it
Turn your view around
Dry your eyes
Eyes like yours should carry a smile
I haven't seen them sparkle in a while
Give it one more try
Dry your eyes'Cause if you're ever believing
I'm thinking of leaving
Look to the moon
'Cause it's a fact
She may go wandering about
But she always comes shining back
And it's true
I'll wait for you 
Sittin' in Darwin's theory
You're down in the forty-eight
I'm practicin' politics
You're practicin' guitar and stayin' out late
How'd we get so turned around?
Why did we make it so hard?
Why can't we cut it out tender?
Give us something good to rememberHey my, my, my rock star
Saw your feet leave the ground
You said all I wanted to be is loud
I was usherin' your friends in

Why did you make it so hard?
Why can't you cut it out I'm tender?
Give me something good to rememberI said
Cut it out

In the wintertime I'm free

Nowhere is warm enough for me

Why did I make it so hard?
Can't I cut it our you're tender?
Give you something good to rememberBaby you tell me what happened
(Why did we make it so hard?)

"Daddy's All Gone" is a James Taylor song. A live IG version appears
on "Shades of Indigo." If you ask me, that song alone is worth the
price of the disc. Em really shines, I think. Especially on the
word "train" that goes on forever... what SOUL... ooooh.
And her solo guitar arrangement is cool, too.
Daddy's All Gone.
Don't have much to say
Thought I'd call you up anyway
Just to try and tell you the way
That I feel today -
Oh, I miss you baby.
Sure, I'm on the road
I don't need to say much more
Just the same old well known stranger
That I was before -
Seems like yesterday.
Daddy's all gone
He's just a halfway home
He's holding on to the telephone
Singing "Please -
Don't let the show go on."
There's a bus every other hour
Even a midnight train
But that don't leave me the power
To see your face again -
It's not that simple anymore.
You see, there's a room full of smiling faces
And there's a man standing by the door
When he says it's time we take our places
And get down on the floor -
Oh, I'd like to kill him, baby.
Daddy's all gone
He's just a halfway home
He's hanging on to the microphone
Singing "Please -
Don't let the show go on." 
I heard that you were drunk and mean down at
Dairy queen
There's just enough of you in me
For me to have this sympathyAnd take it in stride
I know I had mine
And you were as kind
I am toldAin't it funny how we lose one day
And a lifetime slips away
I'm looking back on us that way
Something I never thought I'd say
I take it in stride
I know I had mine
It was good for a time
I am told
It was good for a time
I am toldThe love you gave was not for free
But the price was truly fair
I never felt so glad to be
So well spent and so beyond repair
I take it in stride
At least you were mine
If not for all time
Enough to hold
Or at least, enough for me to hold you 
Oh the boys of Dublin's Donaghmede
Come to hear their boxer sing
To tell the stories of their streets
To quell their suffering
They say let me go another round
And never take it laying down
'Cause in my heart I know
I'm strong enough to grow
Damo sing another song
For all the sons of fisticuffs
For the daughters of the truncheon
Damo sing a song of love
What do I know of Ireland
Except what made it here
Through the ports, into the hills
A whistle and a jig
They worked the fields, they worked the rails
And sang the songs of slaves
To keep the chains from binding on
To keep their bodies brave
Damo sing another song
For all the sons of toil and tug
For the daughters of the weary road
Damo sing a song of love
So gather round and bear this ground
While your brothers sweat and swing
Or hold each other for their life
In their love and in their rage
Sing of tribes and ties that bind
And sing yourself anew
Yeah the Dog of war, Lamb of God
The spirit is in you
Damo sing another song
For all the sons of fisticuffs
For the daughters of the truncheon
Damo sing a song of love
Damo sing another song
For all the sons of toil and tug
For the daughters of the weary road
Damo sing a song of love 
Dancing shoes
On the wall above your bedside
Saw it all as we performed our pirouette
Fleshes fused
As the flicker of the candles
Threw upon the wall a single silhouetteTu es dans ma coeur et dans ma teteDancing shoes
We have loved on distant beaches
Where the winter never reaches
There we fell
Dying swan
On the dawn you danced before me
Though your eyes were dark and stormy
I stood stillQui peut dire le faux et le re'el 
People smile and tell me I'm a lucky one
We've just begun
I think I'm gonna have a son
And he will be like he and me as free as a dove
Conceived in love
The sun is gonna shine aboveEven though we ain't got money
Well I'm so in love with you honey
And everything will bring a chain of love
And in the morning when I rise
You bring a tear of joy to my eyes
And tell me everything is gonna be all rightLove a boy who holds the world in a paper cup
Drink it up
Love him and he'll bring you luck
And if you find he helps your mind
Sister take him home
Don't you live alone
Try to earn what lovers ownEven though we ain't got money
Well I'm so in love with you honey
And everything will bring a chain of love
And in the morning when I rise
You bring a tear of joy to my eyes
And tell me everything is gonna be all right 
We were down at Dead Man's Hill
Smoking vines like cigarettes
Looking through the trashy mags
Trying to feel what's coming nextYou told me of crashing cars
Older brothers and late night bars
I told you what I feel most
And you kept it like a ghost foreverDon't you write it down
Remember this in your head
Don't take a picture
Remember this in your heartDon't leave a message
Talk to me face to face
Talk to me face to faceLying on the bright blue jumping mat
Dinner bell is ringing
Barking dogs and model planes
And the sound of passing trainsWe watch for bonfires in the sky
On the beach in July
Spin the bottle steal the kiss
Postcards to the one I miss
Forever the one I miss foreverDon't you write it down
Remember this in your head
Don't take a picture
Remember this in your heartI'll leave a message
When everything comes apart
I'll leave a message
When everything comes apartI remember cats on fire
Gasoline a burning spiral
Standing underneath the night
Fighting back with all my mightEmpty cans and charred remains
Find them in the heat of day
On the top of Dead Man's Hill this
Is what I know of shame forever 
We talked up all night and still came to no conclusion
We started a fight that ended in silent confusion
And as we sat stuck, you could hear the trash truck
Making its way through the neighborhood
Picking up the thrown out, different from house to house
We get to decide, what we think is no goodWe're sculpted from youth, the chipping away makes me weary
And as for the truth, it seems like we just pick a theory
And that's the one that justifies our daily lives
And backs us with quiver and arrows
To protect openings 'cause when the warring begins
How quickly the wide open narrowsInto the smallness of our deconstruction of love
We thought it was changing but it never was
It's just the same as it ever wasA family of foxes came to my yard and dug in
So I looked in a book to see what this could possibly mean
Yeah, 'cause there is fate in the breeze and signs in the trees
And possible tragic events
When enforces collide with the damage strewn wide
And holes blasted straight through the fenceThe sky starts to crash, the rain on the roof starts to drumming
And laid out like cash, your take on my list of shortcomings
And the show starts to close, I know how this goes
The plot a predictable showing
And though it seems grand, we're just one speck of sand
And back to the hourglass we're goingBack to the smallness of our deconstruction of love
We thought it was changing but it never was
Was still in the smallness of our deconstruction of love
We thought it was changing but it never was
Our deconstruction of love
Our deconstruction of love 
I pulled out with the mountain Laurel blooming
On a dirt road that is soon to be paved
Down to the site of my original establishment
And the west end family grave'Cause one day moves into two
(One day moves into two)
And I'm losin'
Everything except for you
(Everything except for you)
And I would sing you a song of devotion
(I would sing you a song of devotion)
Yeah that's what I should do
(That's what I should do)Blood runs thick and when it rains it pours down
(Blood runs thick)
On the family tree on the fields of war
(The family tree on the fields of war)
I spend my time being broken hearted and grieving bound
(I spend my time being broken hearted and grieving bound)
Yeah I haven't much need to look forwardI just let a one day move into two
(One day moves into two)
I'm losin'
Everything except for you
(Everything except for you)
I would sing you a song of devotion
(I should sing you a song of devotion)Book of days
(Book of days)
The way things lay
(The way things lay)
That's just space and time
(That's just space and time)
I gave it up
(I gave it up)
All for a love
(All for a love)
That won't be defined
(That won't be defined)I've had enough temporary acquisition
Building fences for no gain
(Building fences for no gain)
Taking dead trees down before the winter freeze
(Taking dead trees down before the winter freeze)
I said let 'em rot and fall where they mayJust let one day move into two
(One day moves into two)
I'm losin'
Everything except for you
(Everything except for you)
Ah yeah
I would sing you a song of devotion
(I would sing you a song of devotion)
That's what I should do
(I gotta let them fall where they may)
('Cause one day moves into two)It's the book of days
(I'm losin')
It's the way things lay
(Everything except for you)
Now that's just space and time
(I, I would sing you a song)
I gave it up
(Of devotion)
All for your love
(Yeah)
That's what I should do
(That's what I should do)
That's what I should do
(That's what I should do)
Yeah
That's what I should do
(That's what I should do) 
Tryna remember the very last time
I felt a simple thing going past
Was it the day in Old Georgia
You were tryna take a bath?She sees the daylilies post inside
And the tears spring to her eyes
You turn the car around and you're
Headed back down that track
She's had a heart attackBut the bottle of Jack sits on the counter
Like the devil she knows
And he beats her up and she fills her cup
In the ambers of a dime fire glowSee how she looked in her school year book
Her friends signed imagines all around
But would you stay in touch you know
I miss you so much and I hope we get out of this townEvery day that you get up and force your cards
You're playin' your story in fits and stars
You take your prospects and your pickaxe
And you trudge down to the stream
And you bloody your hands diggin' for your dreamI went lookin' for the answers from someone
I heard believes that life gets easier
And you learn how to breathe and you learn
How to grieve your pastYou study the masters and their books
Givin' in to the barbs and hooks
Till you except it with grace
When your true love doesn't lastEvery day that you get up and force your cards
You're playin' your story in fits and stars
You take your prospects and your pickaxe
And you trudge down to the stream
And you bloody your hands diggin' for your dreamEvery day that you get up and force your cards
You're playin' your story in fits and stars
Your take your prospects and your pickaxe
And you trudge down to the stream
And you bloody your hands diggin' for your dreamEvery day, every day that you go down, down, down
You will bloody, you will bloody your hands
Take your prospects and your pickaxe and you trudge down
You take your prospects and your pickaxe and you trudge down
You take your prospects and your pickaxe and you trudge down
You take your prospects and your pickaxe and you trudge down 
You're looking at foreclosure and doing time
And it don't sound good this time
They found the math and the scales
And the wife that made your life hellAll the time
You were telling me you were fine
Oh, silly man, silly manSo I got your dog, how is that?
I made it nice, I wrote a check
And you cut the weeds back on my drive
'Cause you're a good guy, deep down insideWhat makes a boy like you go bad
What makes a man so lonely and sad
That he'd poison all he knows
And in one year, just let it go?And all that time
You were telling me you were fine
Oh, silly man, silly boyYeah, it's been you and me on this frontier
Trying not to be suburban pioneers
Fighting off the pavers and the associations
And the covenants against the trailersI remember how, how we used to laugh
At all those rotten men in cameo drag
With their advantage and their guns
Up the deer stand shooting up a stormAnd all the time
You were telling me all those lies
Oh, silly man, a silly girlYeah, you and me
We used to hibernate like bears
But we finally come up for air
And everything's all marked and cleared
Survey flags flying everywhereOnce you told me what
What I'll miss the most
Is just being the only ones
With our dirt and our dead ends
And no one turn us inOnce you told me what
What I'll miss the most
Is just being the only ones
With our dirt and our dead ends 
She's got a case against me
A jury of my peers
And the rage of the righteous
Screamin' in her ears
I'm not dignified anymore
I can't say I didn't call
I say, "I love you"
She don't hear me anymoreAnd don't give that girl a gun
I said now don't give that girl a gun
She's already won
She's already wonI made a bad connection
She says, "I was astray"
I jumped ship, abandoned my post
I didn't think I lost my way
But oh, how the mighty fall
I saw her crack a smile
I don't got a chance for redemption
She don't believe in the miracle mileSo take the first shot baby, it'll be real clean
I'm your girl, strong and mean
Second shot baby, it'll be real cool
I'm your foolI said now don't give that girl a gun
I said now don't give that girl a gun
(Give that girl a gun)
She's already won

'Cause somethin's happenin'
Why can't we come together?"
She said, "I doubt we ever will
Ever will get ourself down"

"Don't Give Up on Me, Baby" is an Emily Saliers song, which was
probably written in 1986. They performed it live for WRFG's "What
the Folk" radio show in that year, and that performance was later
released on the 1987 album "Don't Eat Out of Dented Cans." It's a
cute little song, which reminds me a lot of "Crazy Game." In fact,
Emily plays the sole guitar part on this song, too.
Don't Give Up on Me, Baby
Don't, don't give up on me, baby
Though we've seen shaky times
There's still solid ground to be found
I said, don't, don't give up on me, baby
Though I may seem strong
It's only because you're around.
You know me better than I do
You know how things go to my head
I said a few things to you
Things that were better left unsaid
But don't, don't give up on me, baby
'Cause you know I love you, and I always, always will.
Now, love, love's a sweet kind of pain
It can give you wings to fly
Then it drags you on down
But, darling, I'll never love this way again, no
You're the sweetest, sweetest, sweetest love
I've ever found.
You know me better than I do
You know how things go to my head
I said a few things to you
Things that were better left unsaid
But don't, don't give up on me, baby, no
'Cause I love you, and I always, I always will. 
"Don't Know Your Name" is one of the few songs that the girls
co-wrote. In this case, Amy wrote the music, and Emily wrote the
words. The song originally appears on "Blue Food," in a live version
complete with a little introduction...
Don't Kno
w Your Name.
A: We want you to know before we do it that this does not
promote... um, promis...promiscuous sex, or anything like that, in
any way. We... This is sarcastic - we're putting down the meat
market, basically.
E: It's not our philosoph
y on life, or anything.
A: Yeah. Really.
E: Of course, I wrote the words, you know, but...
A: That's right.
E (in mock drunken voice): I was SO WASTED, you know...
Audience member: What are you trying to say?
E (very straight): Nothing. We aren't s
aying a thing. We're
just talking.
A: We're trying to say that, uh, we're not Madonna.
(Laughs.)
E: This is a dirty song. Hope y'all like it.
(music begins.)
E: Amy wrote the music.
-----------------------
E (spoken): I walked into my favor
ite place one night; I just
got back from a lecture, and I was feeling kind of uptight. And at
the end of the bar, there was this guy, and, you know, I wasn't
really looking, but I caught him out of the corner of my eye. The
next thing I know, he was moving my way - I thought he wanted to
talk, but this is what he had to say:
A (sung): I don't know your name, babe
But I want to be your lover.
I don't know your name, babe
But I want to be your lover.
One time or another, baby -
I want to be your lover.
E: I have to admit, I was a little bit surprised, but I
wasn't really scared, 'cause I was twice his size. So I said to
myself, "Ok, I'll play his game...," and when he turned to me, I gave
him my name.
A: I know your
name, babe
But I got to know your number.
I know your name, babe
But I got to know your number.
I said, one time or another, baby -
I'm gonna be your lover.
E: Well, I said to myself, "This guy is persistent. He's a
little bit dumb, but at least he's consistent." I tried to talk
cool, but when we touched, I went under. I made a quick decision,
and I gave him my number.
A: I know your number
But I don't know what to say, babe.
E (effeminately): That's ok...
A: I know y
our number
But I don't know what to say, babe.
Oh, it don't matter anyway, no -
I don't talk when I'm making love to you
I wanna be you lover...
E: Well, you probably won't believe this, but we got married
one day. And I still don't know if he speaks English, 'cause he
doesn't have much to say. It's a damn good thing I like lying around
- we don't make much conversation - just love-making sounds. (Aside:
You know what I'm talking about? Y'all KNOW what I'm talking about!)
Well, one thing I've learned from being in this state -
E & A (sung): There are other ways to communicate!
A: I don't know your name, babe
But I want to be your lover.
I don't know your name, babe
But I want to be your lover.
One time or a
nother, baby -
I want to be your lover. 
"Don't Think Twice, It's All Right" is a Bob Dylan song from 1963.
The girls have performed it a few times with Joan Baez.
It ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe
If you don't know by now
It ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe
It don't matter anyhow
When the rooster crows at the break of dawn
Look out your window and I'll be gone
You're the reason I'm travelin' on
But don't think twice, it's all right.
It ain't no use in turnin' on your light, babe
It's a light I never knowed
It ain't no use in turnin' on your light, babe
I'm on the dark side of the road
Still, I wish there was something you could do or say
To try and make me change my mind and stay
We never did too much talkin' anyway
So don't think twice, it's all right.
It ain't no use in callin' out my name, now
Like you've never done before
It ain't no use in callin' out my name, now
I can't hear you anymore
I'm a-thinkin' and a-wond'rin' all the way down the road
I once loved a woman, a child, I'm told
I gave her my heart but she wanted my soul
But don't think twice, it's all right.
I'm walkin' down that long, lonesome road, babe
Where I'm bound, I can't tell
But goodbye's too good a word, babe
So I'll just say "Fare Thee Well."
I ain't saying you treated me unkind
You could have done better, but I don't mind
You just kinda wasted my precious time
But don't think twice, it's all right
Don't think twice, it's all right. 
Be on my side, I'll be on your side
There is no reason for you to hide
It's so hard, staying here all alone
You could be taking me for a rideShe could drag me over the rainbow
Send me away
Down by the river, I shot my baby
Down by the river, deadTake my hand, I'll take your hand, baby
Together we may get away
This much madness is too much sorrow
It's impossible to make it today, oh babyShe could drag me over the rainbow
Send me away
Down by the river, I shot my baby
Down by the river, deadBe on my side, I'll be on your side
Baby, there ain't no reason for us to hide
It's so hard, staying here all alone
You should be taking me for a ride, oh babyShe could drag me over the rainbow
And send me away
Down by the river, I shot my baby
Down by the river, I shot my babyYou take my hand and I'll take your hand baby
Together we may get away
This much madness is too much sorrow
It's impossible to make it today
This much madness is too much sorrow
It's impossible to make it today
Down by the river 
You can write me a letter
But I won't tell you where I am
You can send me a postcard, baby
But I won't tell you where I stand
Well, I'm right outside of your window
And I'm walking on through your love
And I'm giving you all I can, babe
But I know you've been thinking "No."
And now, baby, it's time
Baby, it's time
To draw the line
Draw the line
You may have good intentions
And I may be dead wrong
If what you see here isn't love, babe
It's 'cause I'm too tired to be that strong
Now I'm burned out on your affection
Because it comes from a jaded tongue
And I'm burned out on your direction, baby
I know I'm not the only one
Baby, it's time
Baby, it's time
To draw the line
Draw the line
Draw that line, baby
Draw that line, yeah
Keep it straight
Keep it close
And tell me
What do you have in mind?
(solo)
I'm gonna take this heartache
I'm gonna turn it all inside out
I'm gonna find every livin' last drop of love
Until I'm too sure to have any doubt
Now you can love me if you want me
Or you can turn away and tell me to go
Now you can write me a letter
You can send me a postcard
But don't tell me what you're thinking
If you really don't know, baby
Baby, it's time to draw the line
Draw the line
Yeah, draw that line 
Day after day I'm more confused
Still I look for the sun through the pouring rain
You know that's a game that I hate to lose
And I'm feeling the strain
Ain't it a shameGive me the beat boys and free my soul
I want to get lost in your rock and roll and drift away
Give me the beat boys and free my soul
I want to get lost in your rock and roll and drift awayBeginning to think that I'm wasting time
I don't understand the things I do
World outside looks so unkind
And I'm counting on you to carry me throughOh give me the beat boys and free my soul
I want to get lost in your rock and roll and drift away
I said give me the beat boys and free my soul
I want to get lost in your rock and roll and drift awayWhen my mind is free
You know that a melody can move me
And when I'm feeling blue
The guitars coming through to soothe meThanks for the joy that you've given me
I want you to know I believe in your song
Rhythm and rhyme and harmony
You've helped me along making me strongOh give me the beat boys and free my soul
I want to get lost in your rock and roll and drift away
I said give me the beat boys and free my soul
I want to get lost in your rock and roll and drift awayGive me the beat boys and free my soul
I want to get lost in your rock and roll and drift away all right
I said give me the beat boys and free my soul
(oh now it's time to come on and free my soul)
I want to get lost in your rock and roll and drift away
(we're gonna drift away)
Why don't you give me the beat boys and free my soul
(take me, take me, take me away)
I want to get lost in your rock and roll and drift away
(oh)
I said give me the beat boys and free my soul
I want to get lost in your rock and roll and drift away 
I fell for guys who tried to commit suicide
With soft rock hair, blood shot eyes
Tastes like Marlboro cigarettes, Reese's Peanut Butter Cups
Pepsi in his hand, getting off the school busFilms and drills, safety illustrations
The crushed cars of driver education, driver educationNow its tattooed girls with a past they can't remember
Who pledged allegiance to a life of bending the curriculum
She tastes like spring, there she goes again
Drinking with the older guys, tripping by the lakesideFilms and drills and safety illustrations
The crushed cars of driver education, driver educationWhen you were sweet sixteen, I was already mean
And feeling bad for giving it up to the man just to make the scene
Where were you, back when I had something to prove?
With the switchblade set and the church kids learning my movesI ran for miles through the suburbs of the seventies
Pollen dust and Pixie sticks, kissing in the deep end
Of swimming pools before I knew what's in there
We come into this life waterlogged and tenderFilms and drills and safety illustrations
The crushed cars of driver education
Films and drills and safety illustrations
The crushed cars of driver education, driver education
Driver education, driver education, driver education 
 
Time, where have you left me?
Here - without a heart
Without an answer
I tried to open my eyes
I tried to see the song
All things considered
This much remains the same
Hit that wall again
The same old barrier
Time after time I've tried to glimpse the other side
Oh, and time surely made me see
I was taking your love so carelessly
Now we know
Though it doesn't do much good anymore
I still feel the old, familiar pain
It could be that love is blind
I was blind to all your reasoning
But, at the start, you were blind to me
Now, I guess you could say we're even
But isn't that what we always wanted to be?
Putting our souls on the line to win this game
I'm feeling the strain
Now, I'll always love you
Through all this distance
All these barriers
Trying to erase the pain
Erase the pain
Erase the pain 
Through the wind and the rain
I hear my mother's cry
She says I know my baby's out there
Just couldn't bear to ask her why
From my womb into the world
Lord I wish the child would call
You know I'm needing some company
She makes my life so full
Take my advice
Go ahead and live your own life
But everybody's waiting
For someone to come homeLike the fire waits for the sand
This world is burning
With the tension of human hands
Waiting to be cleansed
Waiting for their ace of spades
They say I sure hope he's coming
'Cause I feel like I've just been saved
Take my advice
Go ahead and live while you're alive
Everybody's waiting
For someone to come homeCome to me and cleanse my soul
I'm free, I'm free
Only with you am I whole
Can't you see that I am me
I'll be waiting by the window
I'll be heading for the doorI was driving down highway eighty-five, yeah
Had to pull off the road
Just to hear my radio coming in clearer
Lord this life's so full I said
Why do we ask for more
While we're waiting for the man to come
We forgot what he's coming for
Won't take my advice
Go ahead and live while you're alive
Everybody's waiting
For someone to come home
I'll be waiting by the window
Everybody's waiting
For someone to come home
I'll be waiting by the window
Everybody's waiting
For someone to come home
Come home 
Through the wind and the rain
I hear my mother's cry
She says I know my baby's out there
Just couldn't bear to ask her why
From my womb into the world
Lord I wish the child would call
You know I'm needing some company
She makes my life so full
Take my advice
Go ahead and live your own life

Come home 
It's like an ocean tide
Slowly washing my shores away
It's like the sun above
Now, sooner or later, I'll have to face that way
Now she asks me how you're doing
And I tell her you're getting by
But it's pain and numbness
Side by side
You came on the scene
Like a star in the Northern night
She spread her love to you
Like the warmth of a Southern sky
And so it goes on
You know it's night and day
One always slips away
There's no one left to blame
Love falls down, you know
And your heart falls to pieces
And your soul might get lost along the way
All these songs, they used to make you shine
They are just lullabies for your nightmares
I don't want to shed your tears
I followed you Northern star
And I shared the fall with you
Now I felt the cold glow of the sunset
And I saw that liar's moon
Some of us will come down to earth
Some of us will burn
Love's not always as bright as it should be
Tell me, do you want to be free?
Well, your love falls down, you know
And your heart might fall to pieces
And I saw your soul get lost along the way
All these songs, now, they used to make you shine
They are just lullabies for your nightmares
And I'll sing them softly, now
Lately I've felt the warmth
Of the one who tore down my walls
But then I look at you
And your twilight consumes it all, it does
Now I wished upon your falling star
Praying I won't fall that hard
And that my love is all it seems to be
Because I'll swear it set me free
But Emily, I gotta tell you I understand, I understand
When your love flies away, well, honesty
That's about the best you can, the best you can do
But aren't you empty inside, aren't you?
Fallin' Star 
"Fallin' Star" is an Amy Ray song. It appears on her early demo/
solo album, "Color Me Grey." It was probably written around 1984-6.
Fallin' Star
It's like an ocean tide
Slowly washing my shores away
It's like the sun above
Now, sooner or later, I'll have to face that way
Now she asks me how you're doing
And I tell her you're getting by
But it's pain and numbness
Side by side
You came on the scene
Like a star in the Northern night
She spread her love to you
Like the warmth of a Southern sky
And so it goes on
You know it's night and day
One always slips away
There's no one left to blame
Love falls down, you know
And your heart falls to pieces
And your soul might get lost along the way
All these songs, they used to make you shine
They are just lullabies for your nightmares
I don't want to shed your tears
I followed you Northern star
And I shared the fall with you
Now I felt the cold glow of the sunset
And I saw that liar's moon
Some of us will come down to earth
Some of us will burn
Love's not always as bright as it should be
Tell me, do you want to be free?
Well, your love falls down, you know
And your heart might fall to pieces

But aren't you empty inside, aren't you?
Fallin' Star. 
Fare thee well my bright star
I watched your taillights blaze into nothingness
But you were long gone before I ever got to you
Before you blazed past this addressAnd now I think of having loved and having lost
You never know what it's like to never love
Who can say what's better and my heart's become the cost?
A mere token of a brighter jewel sent from aboveFare thee well my bright star
The vanity of youth the color of your eyes
And maybe if I'd fanned the blazing fire of your day-to-day
Or if I'd been older I'd been wiseBut too thick the heat of those long summer evenings
For a cool evening I began to yearn
But you could only feed upon the things which feed a fire
Waiting to see if I would burnFare thee well my bright star
It was a brief brilliant miracle dive
That which I looked up to and I clung to for dear life
Had to burn itself up just to make itself aliveAnd I caught you then in your moment of glory
Your last dramatic scene against a night sky stage
With a memory so clear that it's as if you're still before me
My once in a lifetime star of an ageSo fare thee well my bright star
Last night the tongues of fire circled me around
And this strange season of pain will come to pass
When the healing hands of autumn cool me down 
It's not time to make a change
Just relax and take it easy
You're still young that's your fault
There's so much you have to know
Find a girl and settle down
If you want well you can marry
Look at me I am old but I'm happyI was once like you are now
And I know that it's not easy
To be calm when you've found
Something going on
Take your time think a lot
Think of everything you've got
You will still be here tomorrow
But your dreams may notHow can I try to explain
When I do he turns away again
And it's always been the same
Same old story
From the moment I could talk
I was ordered to listen
Now there's a way and I know
That I have to go away
I know I have to goIt's not time to make a change
(wait, wait)
Just sit down and take it slowly
(wait)
You're still young that's your fault
(I have to go)
There's so much you have to go through
(and make this decision)
Find a girl settle down
(I know)
If you want well you can marry
(know)
Look at me I am old but I'm happy 
On the night they killed Faye Tucker
I was gambling away my last dime
Yeah, well I pulled down the lever
And I sent up a prayerThat my luck would not be denied
My luck would not be deniedRoll out the head of Faye Tucker
Yeah, well never you mind what they say
Well, you may be reborn
But it's all just for scornAnd that's what you'll take to the grave
That's what you'll take to the graveWell, the minister wants you to live now
And the governor wants you to fly
And whatever it was that you thought might occur
Well, they got something else on their minds
They got something else on their mindsIf you live they gonna make you a campaigner
(If you live they gonna make you a campaigner)
If you die they gonna make you a grave
(If you die they gonna make you a grave)Either way it goes down
(Either way it goes down)
Your life's not your own
And that's why killin' dont pay
(Hey, your life's not your own)
I say that's why killin' don't payOoh, ooh, oohI thought I heard the angels bells
They just the hounds of hell
I thought I heard the angels bells
They were just the hounds of hellWhat did you learn Faye Tucker?
Yeah, what will you take from this world?
Yeah well, mercy could prove us
But nothing would move usRise above just being cruel
Rise above just being cruel 
Tell me dark heart of my deep sleep
where the past drops in like unwanted guests
rattling their chains of thought, shuffling their feet
peering into things I thought Id laid to rest
and for all Ive left undone theres another dream to come
once there were wars fought over spice and salt
and the stick of gold became the standard measure
nothing much has changed in this modern age
and it wont until the pains not worth the pleasure
and for all weve left undone
theres another war to come.
I want to feed and water the horses,
the course is long and dry
Cant do it alone oh no we cant although weve tried and tried and tried
we may not deserve you, well come to serve you by and by
Feed and water the horses
where they lie.
I miss the smell of ink on paper and its morning pull
all the news comes via link now all so virtual
I dont know what to think
I dont know what to feel
the beginning of the end or reinvention of the wheel
and for all weve left undone
we are still evolution
I want to feed and water the horses,
the course is long and dry
Cant do it alone oh no we cant although weve tried and tried and tried
we may not deserve you, well come to serve you by and by
Feed and water the horses
where they lie.
I realize that the beast lie there in our plans
peacefully sleeping, but faithfully keeping
theyre ready for the burden man
but if you knew something (peacefully sleeping)
theyd take you to something (faithfully keeping)
you are dying for your burden man (theyre ready for the burden man)
Wouldnt you need it? (Wouldnt you need it?)
Wouldnt you feed it? (Wouldnt you feed it?)
Wouldnt you praise it evermore?
Feed and water the horses
the course is long and dry
Cant do it alone oh no we cant although weve tried and tried and tried
we may not deserve you. Well come to serve you by and by
Feed and water the horses where they lie. 
Won't have you see me as your sad sack
Lost my something and I can't get it back
Or a kill on your trophy rack
I checked my schedule now my train is rolling down a track
Past the sadness of the salt flats
To the prospect of the land fat
Or just a lazy orange house cat
On the sofa where I'll be put upYou've been my hole in my sky
You're my shrinking water supply
Before my well runs dry
I'm going round round round the bend
Fill it up againI'd like to say that it was clear to me
Love triangle geometry
But in the end it's still a mystery
The placement of affection and the disarray
I gathered up the courage that it took
Made that bed and took one last look
And you could hear the pages flapping in the wind blown
Book of my days, my daysYou've been my hole in my sky
You're my shrinking water supply
Before my well runs dry
I'm going round round round the bend
Fill it up againOne tank gone second thoughts are on my mind
What's this trip gonna cost me this time
The devil I know is starting to look awfully kind
But the new road is an old friend
Fill it up againHole in my sky
My sky, my sky
Hole in my sky
My sky, my sky
Hole in my sky
My sky, my skyYou been my hole in my sky (hole in my sky)
My shrinking water supply (my shrinking water supply)
Before my well runs dry (before my well runs dry)
You've been the hole in my sky (I'm going round round round the bend)
My shrinking water supply (to fill it up again)
Before my well runs dry
Before my well runs dry
I'm going round round round the bend
Fill it up again 
 
This is my song, O God of all the nations
A song of peace for lands afar and mine
This is my home, the country where my heart is
Here are my hopes, my dreams, my holy shrine
But other hearts in other lands are beating
With hopes and dreams as true and high as mineMy country's skies are bluer than the ocean
And sunlight beams on clover leaf and pine
But other lands have sunlight too and clover
And skies are everywhere as blue as mine
O hear my song, thou God of all the nations
A song of peace for their land and for mine 
Just yesterday morning they let me know you were gone
Suzanne the plans they made put an end to you
I walked out this morning and I wrote down this song
But I just can't remember who to send it to
I've seen fire and I've seen rain
I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend now
But I always thought that I'd see you againWon't you look down upon me jesus
You gotta help me make a stand
You just got to see me through another day
My body's achin' and my time is at hand
I won't make it any other way
I've seen fire and I've seen rain
I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend now
But I always thought that I'd see you againI've been walkin' my mind to an easy time
My back turned towards the sun
Lord knows when the cold wind blows it'll turn your head around
But there's hours of time on the telephone line
To talk about things to come
Sweet dreams and flying machines in pieces on the ground
I've seen fire and I've seen rain
I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend now now now
But I always thought that I'd see you again 
 
The fisherman comes up, puts his two poles in the sand
He stares out at the sea just exactly like me
But I've got a book in my hand
We will have caught on to something by the end of the day
But mostly we think about the one that got awayI've seen like a bird what pleasures the surface can bring
I've lost my best craft going foolishly back to where to the sirens sing
I've stared up at the place where the water meets the sky
And though I stopped breathing I still believe I should try
Maybe a boat in search of lost treasures will pass by'Cause the fleet of hope is so pretty when she's shining in the port
And the harbor clings to the jetty for protection and support
Out in the choppy waters the sharks swim and play
You're all washed up when Poseidon has his dayI've walked through the desert climbed over mountains so high
Through jungles and plains I took buses and trains
And airplanes across the sky
But none as seductive as ocean before me alone
And now I know why you layered your pockets with stones'Cause the fleet of hope is so pretty when she's shining in the port
And the harbor clings to the jetty for protection and support
Out in the choppy waters the sharks swim and play
You're all washed up when Poseidon has his dayWhen I was a girl all of my fancy took flight
And I had this dream could outshine anything even the darkest night
Now I wait like a widow for someone to come back from sea
I've always known I was waiting for me'Cause the fleet of hope is so pretty when she's shining in the port
And the harbor clings to the jetty for protection and support
Out in the choppy waters the sharks swim and play
You're all washed up when Poseidon has his day 
Fly away little bird
Any place in this open mouth world
Begs to be fed like a bed that beckons you
But you won't restEveryone's got a need to go
Most of us stick with our row to hoe
But not you, you're the black crow
With a straight line and no timeFor the birds of prey who wreck your nest
Twice your size, steal your best
They set you on this course of your collisionI am a stop along your way
I am the words you'll never say
I crossed the great beyond of fear
Opened my eyes and saw us there
What a view, you went there tooFly away little bird
Find the song in you that no one's heard
Strengthen your wings as you sing your solo flight
Through this short lifeEveryone's got a deep regret
We try to ground ourselves to forget
But your race to the end is neck and neck
You love them, you love them notThe birds of prey who wreck your nest
Twice your size steal your best
They set you on this course of your collisionI am a stop along your way
I am the words you'll never say
I crossed the great beyond of fear
Opened my eyes and saw us there
What a view and you went there tooBut all along your chosen path are
Window panes and sheets of glass
That you won't see, you fly too fast
One day it will be overFly away little bird
The saddest song I ever heard
Was the one that I wrote you in my heart
That never made it to the world 
Well I guess that I was lonely
That's why I called you on the phone
'Cause in a moment of forgiveness
I didn't wanna be aloneAnd I guess that I was willin'
More than I ever was before
'Cause in a moment of forgiveness
I come a knockin' at your doorBaby I woke up crying last night
Just to realize that you were gone
Has it been two long years without you
Tell me now
When are you gonna come homeGuess that I was hoping
That you'd finally understand
And in a moment of forgiveness
You'd reach out and take my handNow baby I know (baby I know)
You're not one for bearing witness
And you told me that (one wrong move)
One wrong move is gonna sell you out
And I see that you kept your word (see that you kept your word)
And made it harder than it had to be
Wish I could save you the trouble baby (oh oh oh)
Give you a little piece of mindBaby I woke up crying last night
Just to realize that you were gone
It's been two long years without you
When are you gonna come homeGuess that I was hoping
That you'd finally understand
And in a moment of forgiveness
You'd reach out and take my handAnd in a moment of forgiveness
You'd reach out and take my hand 
A hard knock
A cold clock ticking off my time
A long look
But no luck, couldn't seem to find
Or unwind into peace of mind
Though I was tryingA quick glance
A big chance, my heart beat like a drum
I saw you
And I knew chances just don't come
Round again
Not like this
First a laugh
Then the kissAnd I'm free in you
I've got no worries on my mind
I know what to do
That's to treat you right and love you kind
Thank you ever on my mind
Love is just like breathing when it's true
And I'm free in youThe lost time
The self crime my big mistakes
The clear voice of bad choice
Sounding like an ache
In my day not too bad
But too real
To go awayBut now I'm free in you
I got no worries on my mind
I know what to do
That's to treat you right and love you kind
Thank you ever on my mind
Love is just like breathing when it's true
And I'm free in youAnd I don't know
How you show
Such gentle disregard
For the ugly in me
That I see
That for so long
I took so hard (I took so hard)
But I truly believe (I truly believe)
That you see the best in me (that you see the best in me)
I'm enough for your love (enough for your love)
And the thought sets me
Free! In you
Got no worries on my mind
I know what to do
That's to treat you right and love you kind
Thank you ever on my mind
Love is just like breathing when it's trueAnd I'm free in you
Yes I'm free
In you 
Soft in the morning
Love without warning
Peace 'cause there's no disguising it
When it's love, you can't hide from it
Now, I don't want to be the shadow
When you find your new life
I only want to hold you in the dead of night
But you don't have to search for me
You don't have to set yourself free
You are free through eternity
Now, I have learned to sing with a steady mind
Fill the void, and pass the time
And face this ground, and erase the blue
When I leave the scene, it all comes down to you
You don't have to search for me
And you don't have to set yourself free
You are free through eternity
Now I know it's gotta be hard to find
That blessed balance - that fine line
But turn around and bless me
Or let me go in peace
I can meet you halfway
And give you all you need
But you don't have to search for me
And you don't ever have to set yourself free
You are free
Eternity
Eternity
You are free eternally
You are free 
I'm harboring a fugitive, a defector of a kind
And she lives in my soul and drinks of my wine
And I'd give my last breath to keep us alive
Are they coming for us with cameras or guns?
We don't know which but we gotta run
And you say, "This is not what I bargained for"So hide yourself
For me
All for meWe swore to ourselves we'd go to the end of the world
But I got caught up in the whirl and the twirl of it all
A day in the sun dancing alone
Baby, I'm so sorry
Now it's coming to you the lessons I've learned
Won't do you any good you've got to get burned
Well the curse and the blessing they're one in the same
Baby, it's all such a treacherous gainHide yourself from me
I said hide yourself from me
All for meOoh!
Ooh!I stood without clothes danced in the sand
I was aching with freedom kissing the damned
I said remember this as how it should be
Oh baby, I said it's all in our hands
Got to learn to respect what we don't understand
We are fortunate ones, fortunate ones, I swearHide yourself for me
I will hide myself for you
All for you
All for you
I will myself for you
All for youI stood without clothes I danced in the sand
I was aching with freedom kissing the damned
I said remember this as how it should be 
I'm gonna clear my head
I'm gonna drink that sunThe saddest sight my eyes can see
Is that big ball of orange sinkin' slyly down the trees
Sittin' in a broken circle
While you rest upon my knee
This perfect moments will soon be leavin' meSuzanne calls from Boston
The coffee's hot the corn is high
And that same sun that warms your heart
Will suck the good earth dry
With everything it's opposite enough to keep you cryin'
Or keep this old world spinnin' with a twinkle in its eyeGet out the map
Get out the map and lay your finger anywhere down
We'll leave the figurin' to those we pass on our way out of town
Don't drink the water
There seems to be somethin' ailin' everyone
I'm gonna clear my head
I'm gonna drink that sun
I'm gonna love you good and strong
While our love is good and youngJoni left for South Africa a few years ago
And then Beth took a job
All the way over on the West Coast
And me, I'm still tryin' to live half a life on the road
Seems I'm heavier by the year (heavier by the year)
And heavier by the load (heavier by the load)Why do we hurtle ourselves
Through every inch of time and space?
I must say around some corner
I can sense a restin' place
With every lesson learned
A line upon your beautiful face
We'll amuse ourselves one day
With these memories we'll traceGet out the map
Get out the map and lay your finger anywhere down
We'll leave the figurin' to those we pass on our way out of town
Don't drink the water
There seems to be somethin' ailin' everyone
I'm gonna clear my head (I'm gonna clear my head)
I'm gonna drink that sun (I'm gonna drink that sun)
I'm gonna love you good and strong
While our love is good and youngI'm gonna clear my head
I'm gonna drink that sun
I'm gonna love you good and strong
While our love is good and young 
Love is but a song we sing
And fear's the way we die
You can make the mountains ring
Or make the Angels cry
Though the bird is on the wing
You may not know whyCome on people now
Smile on your brother
Everybody get together
Try to love one another right nowSome may come and some may go
We will surely pass
When the one that left us here
Returns for us at last
We are but a moment's sunlight
Fading in the grass yeahCome on people now
Smile on your brother
Everybody get together
Try to love one another right nowCome on people now
Smile on your brother
Everybody get together
Try to love one another right nowIf you hear the song we sing
You will understand
You hold the key to love and fear
All in your trembling hand
Just one key unlocks them both
It's there at your commandCome on people now
Smile on your brother
Everybody get together
Try to love one another right nowYeah come on people now
Smile on your brother
Everybody get together
Try to love one another right now
Try to love one another right now
Try to love one another right now 
There's a letter on the desktop that I dug out of a drawer
The last truce we ever came to
In our adolescent war
And I start to feel the fever
From the warm air through the screen
You come regular like seasons
Shadowing my dreamsAnd the Mississippi's mighty
But it starts in Minnesota
At a place that you could walk across
With five steps down
And I guess that's how you started
Like a pinprick to my heart
But at this point you rush right through me
And I start to drownAnd there's not enough room
In this world for my pain
Signals cross and love gets lost
And time passed makes it plain
Of all my demon spirits
I need you the most
I'm in love with your ghost
I'm in love with your ghostDark and dangerous like a secret (don't tell a soul)
That gets whispered in a hush
When I wake the things I dreamed about you (don't tell a soul)
Last night make me blush
And you kiss me like a lover
Then you sting me like a viper
I go follow to the river
Play your memory like a piperAnd I feel it like a sickness
How this love is killing me
I'd walk into the fingers
Of your fire willingly
And dance the edge of sanity
I've never been this close
In love with your ghost, oohOoh
Unknowing captor
You never know how much you
Pierce my spirit
But I can't touch you
Can you hear it
A cry to be free
Oh I'm forever under lock and key
As you pass through meNow I see your face before me
I would launch a thousand ships
To bring your heart back to my island
As the sand beneath me slips
As I burn up in your presence
And I know now how it feels
To be weakened like Achilles
With you always at my heelsThis bitter pill I swallow
Is the silence that I keep
It poisons me I can't swim free
The river is too deep
Though I'm baptized by your touch
I am no worse than most
In love with your ghost (in love with your ghost)You are shadowing my dreams
(In love with your ghost)
(In love with your ghost) 
Jimmy died on his couch yesterday
A friend of his ex wife called me to say
He just gave it to God, slipped from the livin'
With the bills pilin' up and a back that was givin' inIt's been years since I've seen anyone
Now I'm just sittin' here in the dark
Stallin' out in my car wishing I could bum a light
From the ghost of the gang tonightKathy lost a nephew under the wheels of a train
In a midday suicide after a losing streak
He just stood on the tracks and gave it to glory
I never called her, to say I'm sorry, my friendIt's been years, but I'm thinking about you
And all of your tears and I'm sitting here in the dark
Afraid to make a stupid call wishing I could bum a light
From the ghost of the gang tonightTonight I'm gonna take that ride for the years
We missed and the friends that died
Sideswiped baby on the road somehow with a pack of dreams
That just weren't allowedMaybe you're walking those halls all quiet and sad
Sitting in the dark all scared and mad
Feel my hand reach across and don't forget
Where you come from baby, 'cause there's truth in itOh yeah, we huddled against the cold in those days
By the light of a fire in a pep-rally haze
With the smoke and lives past, and a reason for livin'
No matter how bad it got, we wouldn't give in to itIt's been years, since I've seen anyone cry these tears
Now I'm sitting here in the dark
Stalling out in my car wishing I could bum a ride
From the ghost of the gang tonight(Ghost of the gang, ghost of the gang)
Ghost of the gang tonight
(Ghost of the gang, ghost of the gang, ghost of the gang)
Ghost of the gang tonight 
There are some things you can't cover up
With lipstick and powder
I thought I heard you mention my name
Can't you talk any louder
Don't come any closer don't come any nearer
My vision of you can't get any clearer
Oh I wanna hear girls talkI got a loaded imagination
Being fired by girls talk
Oh but I can't say what you want to hear
I suppose we're gonna have to play it by ear
Right here and now
Girls talk and they want to know how
Girls talk and they say it's not allowed
Girls talk if they say that it's so
Don't you think that I know by nowThat they word upon everyones lips
That your dedicated
Although you may be an old fashioned girl
Your still gonna get dated
Ah was it really murder
Were you just pretending
Lately I have heard you are the living end
Girls talk and they want to know about her
Girls talk they want to know if I care
Girls talk and they want to know where
I just want to hear girls talkI gotta loaded imagination
Being fired by girls talk
Oh but I can't say what you want to hear
I suppose we're gonna have to play it by ear
Right here and now
Girls talk and they want to know how
Girls talk and they say it's not allowed
Girls talk
Girls talk and they want to know about her
You know they want to know where
Wanna know if I care
I said girls talk

GONEA long drink of water and a pickup truck
On a bone dry summer I've been out of luck
But when you blew into town I felt the winds of change
A little bit scary and a little bit strange
I know from being broken harder
With nothing to lose
Doesn't take much around here
To make such big news
And I'm gone
Mama left her warning from the old front porch
But Im gone
They say you'll burn me like you're Sherman with a big bad torch
I've seen a million suns go down on this tired town
Now you're here and I'm gone
So in comes the stranger to the tight lipped frowns
The walls come up and the shades go down
I can't help but see it like a movie scene
Where you bust on through and you rescue me
And the sign of a happy ending is an out of state tag
Outside of the house where the girl inside is packing her bags
And Im gone
Does it seem like its too much to ask
For reckless grin and a tank full of gas
Gone
And I don't know if I will ever belong
But I'm done here doing time and I'm moving along
And Im gone
Gone
Mama left her warning from the old front porch 
Think I'll bag that trip for two
Pack it up to Kakadu
Honey, it's not for the weather
Lack of loving youI got all this in between
Something I did not foresee
All the deals I made don't matter
If I can't just let you beGone again gone again
There ain't no way
That I'm gonna let this heart mend
Gone againWalked in King's Cross for awhile
Gave a junkie girl a smile
We both traded in for danger
Or the company of strangersShe said all her family
Was at the Welfare Agency
Then she swindled my last twenty
For a kiss and some poetryGone again gone again
'Cause there ain't no way
That I'm gonna let this heart mend
Gone againIf I don't make Kakadu
I'll be at the Rainbow Room
And I'll be courting some disaster
With the Melbourne wrecking crewHoney all this is to say
That every dog don't got it's day
If we take the love we're given take the love
And we throw it all awayIt's gone again it's gone again
'Cause there ain't no way
That I'm gonna let this heart mendIt's gone again it's gone again
'Cause there ain't no way
That I'm gonna let this heart mend
Gone again 
Sometimes I live in the country
Sometimes I live in the town
Sometimes I take a great notion
To jump in the river and drownIrene goodnight

"Half-Moon Cafe" is an Emily Saliers song, written during her
sophomore year at Tulane (the same year she wrote "Play It Again,
Sam"). The sole performance I have is from Live at WREK, on 27
February 1989.
Half-Moon Cafe
At the Half-Moon Cafe, we drink to our lives
Like pseudo-believers in love
We've been through our holes-in-the-walls and the dives
Where you drink to recall what you once had a vision of.
And we talk of our lives in a prison
Though we both know it's better to be
Safe within our indecision
Than taking the risk to be free.
And you were to be a great poet
And I'd find my fame in song
But we somehow saw failure more closely
Than fame all along.
And now you manage a hamburger stand
And I haven't found steady work yet
And we meet here to talk and pretend
That we know no regret.
But how much is chance
How much would you decide
How much is murder of our dreams
How much is suicide?
So you ask of my latest Top 40
And I ask of your latest great fiction
As I step outside I see that the moon is full
I have to laugh at the contradiction.
Well, at least we can laugh at our dreams
Though it's really much more bitter than sweet
Sometimes through all of this fragmentation
I imagine what it feels to be complete.
But how much is chance
How much would you decide
How much is murder of our dreams
How much is suicide? 
The sky is crying
The streets are full of tears
Rain come down
Wash away my fears
And all this writing on the wall
Oh, I can read between the lines
Rain come down
Forgive this dirty town
Rain come down
Give this dirty town
A drink of water
A drink of wine
If I've been hard on you
I never chose to be
I never wanted no one else
I've tried my best to be somebody you'd be close to
Hand in hand
Like lovers are supposed to
As you'd sleep
I'd think my heart will break in two
I'd kiss your cheek
I'd stop myself from waking you
But in the dark you'd speak my name
And say, "Baby, what's wrong?"
Oh, here i am, baby
I'm coming back for more
I'm like a wave
It's got to roll into the shore
Yes, and if my love's in vain
How come my love is so strong?
If I've been hard on you
I never chose to be
I never wanted no one else
I've tried my best to be somebody you'd be close to
Hand in hand
Like lovers are supposed to
Supposed to be
Now, you and me, we go parallel
Together and apart
And you keep the perfect distance
And it's tearing at my heart
'Cause you never feel the distance
But you never tried to cross no lines
'Cause it's another dirty river
And another dirty scar
And I don't know who's kissing you
And I don't know where you are
So far from home
Won't you think of me sometime?
If I've been hard on you
I never chose to be
I never wanted no one else
I've tried my best to be somebody you'd be close to
Hand in hand
Like lovers are supposed to
If I've been hard on you
I never chose to be
I never wanted no one else
I've tried my best to be somebody you'd be close to
Hand in hand
Like lovers are supposed to
Well, the sky is crying
See, the streets are full of tears
Rain come down
Wash away my fears
And all this writing on the wall
Oh, I can read between the lines. 
I've taken, so many down
I've helped them all to dismount
I've followed, so many down
I take their hand me downsAll with hope, all with hope
That emptiness brings fullness
And loss of love brings wholeness
All with hope, all with hope
That emptiness brings fullness
And loss of love brings wholeness
To us allEverything that I believe
Crawls from underneath the streets
Everything I truly love
Comes from somewhere far above
Everything that I believe
Is wrong with you is wrong with me
Everything I truly love
(Everything I truly love)
I love in you and I love in me
(I love in you and I love in me)So give me hope, give me hope
That emptiness brings fullness
And loss of love brings wholeness
To us allSwear you can't swim the river
(Become the beggar now)
(Become the saint somehow)
I saw you runnin' to jump in
(Become the beggar now)
(Become the saint somehow)
I swore, I'd never be your sinner
(Become the beggar now)
(Become the saint somehow)
Til' I held your sin
Hand me downsNow you ask me, why I'm here?
(Now you ask me, why I'm here?)
The same as you, I'm scared, it's fear
I've become the beggar now
And you've become the saint somehow
Twist the words and place the blame
(Twist the words and place the blame)
And tell me now aren't we the same
Trippin' in our yellow feet
(Trippin' in our yellow feet)
Checking underneath our sheetsFor some hope, give me hope
That emptiness brings fullness
And loss of love brings wholeness
Give me hope, give me hope
That emptiness brings fullness
And loss of love brings wholeness
To us all

Thought you were one who wouldn't run
Who wouldn't do me wrong
But the song that you were singing
Was the same old heartache song
You treat me fine and you wined and dined
And I believed you when you said
"I love you, babe," but your only aim
Was to get me in your bed
Now I don't even like you no more
But I can't get you off of my mind
Baby, you've got me livin' in Heartache Central Time
(Heartache Central, Heartache Central, Heartache Central Time)
Anytime is a hurting time
With a hurting heart like mine
God knows I'd get over you if only I could find
A way to get my hurtin' heart
off Heartache Central Time
Remember last September
When you looked into my eyes
I should have known that the love you'd shown
Was nothing more than lies
I fell for you and I know it's true
That I should have stopped myself
But my lonely heart was too alone
To hurt all by itself
Now I don't even like you no more
But I can't get you off of my mind
Baby, you've got me livin' in Heartache Central Time
(Heartache Central, Heartache Central, Heartache Central Time)
Anytime is a hurting time
With a hurting heart like mine
God knows I'd get over you if only I could find
A way to get my hurtin' heart
off Heartache Central Time 
You spent five years saying you'd come my way
Well, that's a little more waiting than a heart can take
Yeah, but now that I know it's just a fantasy
I feel a hard time coming around for meI said oh
Oh oh
Oh oh
There's a heartache for everyone
Oh oh
Oh oh
There's a heartache for everyoneI spent two years saying give me a chance
Yeah, clean it all up and I'll take your hand
But not forever it was understood
Yeah, but just for a while, it would do us some goodI said oh
Oh oh
Oh oh
There's a heartache for everyone
Oh oh
Oh oh
There's a heartache for everyone
I'll wait for you until I know
There's a heartache for everyoneHey Valentine, I'm just a stumbling around
Who knew that Paris was such a lonely town
I'll meet you at the bridge where we wanted to kiss
Or take the high road and be done with thisHey Valentine, I'm just a stumbling around
Who knew that Paris was such a lonely town
I'll meet you at the bridge where we wanted to kiss
Or take the high road and be done with thisI'll give you six more weeks baby just in case
You can change your mind, you won't be replaced
Are we looking at a lifetime of regret
Or just the one little moment that I'll never forgetI said oh
Oh oh
Oh oh
There's a heartache for everyone
Oh oh
Oh ohThere's a heartache for everyone
I'll wait for you until I know
There's a heartache for everyone
I'll wait for you until I know
There's a heartache for everyone 
She's been afraid to go out
She's afraid of a knock on her door
There's always a shade of a doubt
She can never be sure
Who comes to call
Maybe the friend of a friend of a friend
Anyone at all
Anything but nothing againIt used to be her town
It used to be her town too
It used to be her town
It used to be her town tooSeems like even her old girlfriends
Might be talking her down
She's got her name on the grapevine
Running up and down the telephone line
Talking bout someone said someone said
Something bout something else
Someone might have said about her
She always figured that they were her friends
Maybe they can live without herIt used to be her town
It used to be her town too
It used to be her town
It used to be her town tooWell people'd gotten used to seeing them both together
But now she's gone and life goes on
Nothing last forever
Oh noShe gets the house and the garden
He gets the boys in the band
Some of them his friends
Some of them her friends
Some of them understandLord knows that this is just a small town city
Yes and everyone can see you fall
It's got nothing to do with pity
I just wanted to give you a callIt used to be your town
It used to be my town too
But you never know til it all falls down
That somebody loves you
Somebody loves you
Darling somebody still loves you
I can still remember
When it used to be her town tooIt used to be your town
It used to be my town too
Ah but you never know til it all falls down
That somebody loves you
Somebody loves you 
Hey Jesus, it's me
I don't usually talk to you
But my baby's gonna leave me
And there's something you must doAnd I am not your faithful servant
I hang around sometimes with a bunch of your black sheep
But if you make my baby stay, I'll make it up to you
It's a promise I'll keepHey Jesus, it's me
I'm the one who talked to you yesterday
I asked you please, please for a favor but my baby's gone away
Went away, anywayAnd I don't really think it's fair
You've got the power to make us all believe in you
And then we call you in our despair
And you don't come throughHey Jesus, it's me, I'm sorry
I don't remember all I said
I had a few, no, too many and they went straight to my head
And made me feel like I could argue with GodBut you know it's easy for you
You got friends all over the world
You had the whole world waiting for your birth
But now I ain't got nobody, I don't know what my life's worthI'm not gonna call on you any more
I'm sure you've got a million things to do
All I was trying to do was to get through to you
Get through to you'Cause when I die and I get up to your doors
I don't even know if you're gonna let me in the place
How come I gotta die to get a chance to talk to you
Face to face 
Hey kind friend
I don't know when I'll see you again
On a ferry boat bound to Victoria
Layin' down to hide from the windBig dipper hangin' over the city
You know everything now is different for me
And it ain't no use in
Explainin' the sceneryI said, "Kind friend
Help me forget where I been
Kind friend
Remember who I am"I was too late in Spokane
So I caught a ride through the cascade range
I saw the sun die in Olympia
Runnin' down on Capital lakeNow I ask you for some relief
It's one true root that you bring to me
It's 3 a.m.
And it's good companyI said, "Hey kind friend
Help me forget where I been
Hey kind friend
Help me remember who I am"Hey kind friend
Don't know if I'm gonna see you again
It's okay friend
It's okay friend
(it's so hard when they all have to face goin' away)So I'll meet you in New Orleans or I'll see you around
'Cause I don't know if it's worth comin' down
Hey I'm callin' you
From a gold rush townAnd I say, "Hey kind friend
Help me forget where I've been
Hey kind friend
Help me remember who I am"Hey kind friend
I don't know if I'm gonna see you again
It's okay friend
I'm okay friendI said, "I'm okay friend
I'm okay friend"
(See you later) 
You had your chance to show affection
You had your chance to give me more
And now that she's found new direction
You make your way to my back doorWhat makes you think the whole world wants you?
Give steel a kiss and it will bend
The flesh is weak and when it's all been said and done
The spirit's all that's left in the endIf you have to saddle your high horse
Go on and ride out of my sight
(Ride out of my sight)
You never had the time of day for me, you know
And now you want to spend the nightYou're big with the come on like it's no big deal
No big deal to you
You let the wild wind blow your course
(Wild wind blow your course)
I do not want the dirt from your shoes
Or from the hooves of your high horseThe way I see it there are few things left
To hold on to and keep your head, yeah
When it's your sense of humor and integrity
There's nothing funny about what's being saidThere was a day when I would let myself be trampled
As long as it was done by you
(As long as it was done by you)
But I took so much abuse now I've had ample
There's no way that you'll break throughIf you have to saddle your high horse
Go on and ride out of my sight
(Ride out of my sight)
You never had the time of day for me you know
And now you want to spend the nightYou're big with the come on like it's no big deal
No big deal to you
You let the wild wind blow your course
(Wild wind blow your course)
I do not want the dirt from your shoes
Or from the hooves of your high horseYou had your chance to show affection
(You had your chance to show me some affection)
You had your chance to give me more
(You had your chance to give me more, baby)
And now that she's found new direction
You make your way to my back doorWhat makes you think the whole world wants you?
Give steel a kiss and it will bend
The flesh is weak and when it's all been said and done
The spirit's all that's left in the endIf you have to saddle your high horse
Go on and ride out of my sight
(Ride out of my sight)
You never had the time of day for me, you know
And now you want to spend the nightYou're big with the come on like it's no big deal
No big deal to you
You let the wild wind blow your course
(Wild wind blow your course)
I do not want the dirt from your shoes
Or from the hooves of your high horseI do not want the dirt from your shoes
Or from the hooves of your high horse
From your high horse
From your high horse, yeah 
I went all the way to Paris
To forget your face
Captured in stained glass
Young lives long since passed
Statues of lovers every placeI went all across the continent
To relieve this restless love
I walked through the ruins
Icons of glory smashed
By the bombs from aboveSo we must love
While these moments are still called today
Take part in the pain of this passion play
Stretching our youth as we must
Until we are ashes to dust
Until time makes history, of usJeu De Paume's full of faces
Knowing peace, knowing strife
Leisure and toil
Still it's canvas and oil
There's just no medium for lifeIn the midst of the rubble
I felt a sense of rebirth
In a dusty cathedral
The living God called
And I prayed for my life here on earthSo we must love
While these moments are still called today
Take part in the pain of this passion play
Stretching our youth as we must
Until we are ashes to dust
Until time makes history, of usThere are mountains in Switzerland
Brilliant cold as they stand
From my hotel room
Watching the half moon
Bleeding its light like a lambAnd the town is illuminated
Its tiny figures are fast asleep
And it dawns on me
The time is upon me
To return to the flock I must keepSo we must love
While these moments are still called today
Take part in the pain of this passion play
Stretching our youth as we must
Until we are ashes to dust
Until time makes history, of us 
I want to live in a holy city
I want to drink from a holy vine
I want to be where the people are pretty
Just because they feel it deep down inside
Chorus:
I don't want to wait for heaven
I can find what I need right here on earth this time
Too many people hold the way for heaven
If you can't feel it here, you won't feel it there anyway.
I want to live in a stained glass window
I want to change light to day
I want to have the sun shining through me
Causing my existence in every way
Chorus
I want to live in a heart of love
I want to swim in a mind of peace
I want to be your emotional outlet
I want to be love's sweet release
I'm gonna build me a holy city
I'm gonna drink from a holy, holy vine
I'm gonna be where the people are pretty
Because they feel it deep down inside
Chorus 
Christopher Robin and I walked along
As the branches lit up by the moon
Posing our questions to Owl and Eyore
As our days disappeared all too soon
But I wandered much farther today than I should
And I can't seem to find my way back to the woodsSo help me if you can, I've got to get
Back to the house at Pooh corner by one
You'd be surprised there's so much to be done
Count all the bees in the hive
Chase all the clouds from the sky
Back to the days of Christopher Robin and PoohWinnie, the Pooh, doesn't know what to do
Got a honey jar stuck on his nose
Now he came to me asking help and advice
And from here no one knows where he goes
So I sent him to ask of the Owl if he's there
How to loosen a jar from the nose of a bearSo help me if you can, I've got to get
Back to the house at Pooh corner by one
You'd be surprised there's so much to be done
Count all the bees in the hive
Chase all the clouds from the sky
Back to the days of Christopher Robin and PoohSo help me if you can, I've got to get
Back to the house at Pooh corner by one
You'd be surprised there's so much to be done
Count all the bees in the hive
Chase all the clouds from the sky
Back to the days of Christopher RobinBack to the ways of Christopher Robin
Back to the ways of Pooh 
When we tried to rework all of this
Each to her rendition
We painted ourselves in a corner
Lost for ideas, blindly fishingFor a compliment or kindness
Just to bring us into view
But you could not interpret me
And I could not interpret youI remember that cold morning
When the trees were black with birds
I tried to make out some connection
We were at a loss for wordsAfter all that we've been through
I could not see giving up
Despite the picture of our coffee
Growing colder in the cupsI want to say that underneath it all
You are my friend
And the way that I fell for you
I'll never fall that way againI still believe despite our differences
That what we have's enough
And I believe in you
And I believe in loveSo we went rolling on down through the years
Taking time off we could steal
Until the thief of things unreconciled
Stuck a stick into the wheelAnd now we're tumbling in a free fall
No one's gonna go unscathed
But it's not because you held back
And its not how I behavedI want to say that underneath it all
You are my friend
And the way that I fell for ya
I'll never fall that way again
(I will never fall that way again)I still believe despite our differences
That what we have's enough
I believe in you
And I believe in loveThere are avenues and supplements and books stacked on the shelf
Labyrinths of recovery in search of our best self
But most of what will happen now is way out of our hands
So just let it go, see where it landsI want to say that underneath it all
You are my friend
And the way that I fell for you
I'll never fall that way again
(I will never fall that way again)I still believe despite our differences
That what we have's enough
And I believe in you
And I believe in loveI believe in you
And I believe in love 
Emily:
I walked into my favorite place one night
I'd just gotten back from a lecture
And I was feeling kind of uptight
And at the edge of the bar there was this guy
And you know I wasn't really looking
But I caught him out of the corner of my eye
The next thing I know he was moving my way
I thought he wanted to talk
But this is what he had to sayAmy:
I don't know your name babe
But I want to be your lover
Ya'll sing it with me
I don't know your name babe
But I want to be your lover
Your lover your lover your lover
One time or another baby
I want to be your loverEmily:
I have to admit I was a little bit surprised
But I wasn't really scared 'cause I was twice his size
So I said to myself, "okay, I'll play his game"
And when he turned to me
I gave him my nameAmy:
I know your name babe
But I got to know your number
I know your name babe
But I got to know your number your number
I said one time or another baby
I'm gonna be your lover
Yeah I wanna be your loverEmily:
Well I said to myself "this guy is persistent
He's a little bit dumb but at least he's consistent"
I tried to talk cool but when we touched I went under
I made a quick decision and I gave him my numberAmy:
I know your number
But I don't know what to say babeEmily:
That's okAmy:
I know your number
Your number babe
But I don't know what to say to you
Say to you say to you say to you darling
Oh it don't matter anyway no
I don't talk when I'm make love to you babe
I don't talk when I make love
I wanna be you lover
I wanna be you lover
Lover lover
Lover lover
Lover loverEmily:
Well you probably won't believe this
But we got married one day
And I still don't know if he speaks english
'cause he doesn't have much to say
It's a damn good thing I like lying around
We don't make much conversation
But love makes sounds
You know what I'm talking about
Ya'll know what I'm talking about
Well one thing I've learned from being in this stateEmily and amy:
There are other ways to communicateAmy:
I don't know your name babe
But I want to be your lover
Don't know your name babe
But I want to be your lover
Your lover your lover your lover
One time or another baby
I'm gonna be your lover 
You followed me this far
Did you find out what's inside?
Can you tell me what I'm doing?
Is it something I should hide?
I don't know for sure
I don't wanna find out what I left there forI'm not scared and I'm not lonely
I'm not saving all my money or my breath
I'm not looking for an answer
Or asking anyone to second guess, noBut you told me all your secrets
And I filled you up with lies
Now I'm living honestly
Because I said goodbye
I can't go home anymore
I don't wanna find out what I left there forI'm not scared and I'm not lonely
I'm not saving all my money or my breath
I'm not looking for an answer
I'm not asking anyone to second guessI was losing all my senses
I was losing all control
It was gettin' so offensive
No you want me back for more
And I just won't goIf you think you know the answers
Then you've got a lot of gall
'Cause it gives you satisfaction
Knowing nothing at all, I don't care anymore
I don't wanna find out what I left there for
What I left there forI'm not scared and I'm not lonely
I'm not saving all my money or my breath
I'm not looking for an answer
I'm not asking anyone to second guess, noI'm not scared and I'm not lonely
I'm not saving all my money or my breath
I'm not looking for an answer
I'm not asking anyone to second guessTake a second guess
Take a second guess
Take a second guess
... 
I can tell by your eyes
That you've probably been crying forever
And the stars in the sky
Don't mean nothing to you, they're a mirrorI don't wanna talk about it
How you broke my heart
If I stay here just a little bit longer
If I stay here, won't you listen to my heart?
My heartIf I stand all alone
Will the shadows hide the color of my heart?
(Will they be blue for the tears? Black for the nights)
Nights we spent apart
And the stars don't mean nothing to youThey're a mirror
I don't wanna talk about it
How you broke my heart
Oh, if I stay, if I stay here
Won't you listen to my heart? 
I used to mark the calendar and watch the days go by
For the pretty little snowflakes to fall down from the sky
And when they'd whiten the mountaintops, the valleys and the trees
I could feel the Christmas spirit take a hold of meAnd I feel the Christmas spirit blowing in the air
There's lots of joy and happiness in the presents that we share
No other day can take its place throughout my memory
The world is celebrating with friends and familyWhen I was just a girl, at home I waited patiently
To open up my presents underneath the Christmas tree
With holly in the window the fireplace burning bright
The whole world is rejoicing on this Christmas nightI feel the Christmas spirit blowing in the air
There's lots of joy and happiness in the presents that we share
No other day can take its place throughout my memory
The world is celebrating with friends and familyThe children dream of Santa with jingles on the sleigh
Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer gladly leads the way
With joy they all are singing, I hear them laugh and play
Can't you feel the Christmas spirit on this special day?Well, I feel the Christmas spirit blowing in the air
There's lots of joy and happiness in the presents that we share
No other day can take its place throughout my memory
The world is celebrating with friends and familyNo other day can take its place throughout my memory
The world is celebrating with friends and family, family, family

They say everything can be replaced
Yet every distance is not near
So, I remember every face
Of everyone who put me here.Everyone ---> Chorus
I see my light come shining
From the west unto the east
Anyday now, any day now,
I shall be released.Emily ---> 2
They say everyone needs protection,
They say everyone must fall
Yet I swear I see my reflection
Some place so high above this wallEveryone ---> Chorus
I see my light come shining
From the west unto the east
Anyday now, any day now
I shall be released.
Solos / jamsAmy ---> 3
Standing next to me in this lonely crowd,
Is someone who swears he's not to blame.
All day long I hear him shout so loud
Crying out that he's been framed.Everyone ---> Chorus
I see my light come shining
From the west unto the east
Anyday now, anyday now
I shall be released 
 
It was you who walked into my life
You were the one
You hear my cries of loneliness
Through my cool cautious eyes
Can't you see me reaching out for you
Can't you feel me there
Won't you please believe me
I could never touch you for the fear
That I might never let you goIt was you with the courage and the commitment
To start your new life
You make me believe in mine
But can't you see the confusion
Through my troubled smile
I'm torn between losing me
Losing me and gaining youMaybe I've been distant
Maybe I've been cold
But I've done it for my own existence
And I do believe I do believe it's getting oldI might never say that I love you
I might never say I care
But I will tell you now
That I'll always be there 
Looking out across suburban yards
To the construct of our days through the thinning of the trees
How come I only build a house of cards?
That gets blown to pieces by the fall's first fickle breezeWhen I feel that stirring, the illicit kiss
That's just the cool tongue of the devil
With a sucker in his midstOne day I'll change, you'll be the first one that I call
I owe you an apology, too many thanks and that's not all
I've been running long before I learned to crawlMy calendar lies crumbled laid to waste
It's been scrawled on, thumbed through and changed
Will this be the measure of my days?
Dinners and appointments and deadlines I can't makeAnd when I start to feel it making sense for me
That's just hope springing eternally, yeahOne day I'll change, you'll be the first one that I call
I owe you an apology, too many thanks and that's not all
I've been running long before I learned to crawlOutside the summer's gone for good
Dying impatiens stacked up wood
My friend will get together to cook
Talk about what happened, take a second lookThe master loves the servant who blind heeds him
The husband, the obedient wife
The snake will always bite the hand that feeds him
Even if you love him, even if you save his lifeOne day I'll change, you'll be the first one that I call
I owe you an apology, too many thanks and that's not all
I've been running long before I learned to crawl 
Well, you, you can sit in your highchairs
Highchairs are for children
You can sit in your highchairs and laughI'll give you my best face
I'll give you my freedom
I'll give you my feet and my handsI'm keeping my eyes
Open, open, open to the field
Hold your dances there
Take the crop, share the yieldYou can join us together, break us apart
A wound in the skin is a break in the heart
You can coast on your laughter, high shelf your heart
But laughter's for healing, not tearing apartI'm keeping my eyes
Open to the fields
You can hold your dances there
Take the crop, share the yieldNot a soul is lost
But collapse in the walls
You can dance in the dust
You can walk it off, walk, walk it offIf you're falling, you're falling
Come calling to me
Falling, falling
I'll give you my skin
I will give you my skinI'm keeping my eyes
Open to the field
(If you're falling, you're falling, come calling to me)
You can hold your dances here
(If you're falling, you're falling, come calling to me)
Take the crop, share the yield(If you're falling, you're falling, come calling to me)
I'm keeping my eyes
(If you're falling, you're falling, come calling to me)
Open to the field(If you're falling, you're falling, come calling to me)
Hold your dances there
(If you're falling, you're falling, come calling to me)
Take the crop share the yieldIf you're falling, you're falling, come calling to me
If you're falling, you're falling, come calling to me
If you're falling, you're falling, come calling to me
I will give you my skin 
 
You say you want to live for today
Before today is lost
But when the returns come in
Do they balance the cost?
I can see your four wheels spin
I can smell smoke from the blaze
But we aren't moving anyway
If you're seeing past rose colored shades.
Chorus:
If you live like that
Don't look back
'Cause it's cold
And it's mighty
It may turn your back
Blood on the tracks, baby
Blood on the tracks
Blood on the tracks, baby
I said, don't look back.
I see it all around
People want it good and want it fast
As long as it moves you for the moment
It doesn't matter if it lasts
But our love is sweet
It can drive me to my knees
But we still got troubles, you and I
Seeing the forest for the trees.
Chorus.
I've had enough of these two lives
You say you'll give to me
I've had enough of your freedom
You know I want to feel free
I've had enough gospel
I could spin my head around
I said, if you're so caught up in heaven
You don't even see the ground.
Chorus.
All we need is to take time (slow down, new way)
See tomorrow in plain sight (new dawn, new day)
New horizon in plain view
And we're hauling up the engine
To put you straight on through.
Chorus.
Blood on the tracks, baby
Blood on the tracks
Blood on the tracks, baby
I said, don't look back
Blood on the tracks, baby
Blood on the tracks
Blood on the tracks, baby
I said, don't look back
Don't look back
If you live like that 
In the bleak midwinter, frosty wind made moan
Earth stood hard as iron, water like a stone
Snow had fallen, snow on snow, snow on snow
In the bleak midwinter, long agoAngels and archangels may have gathered there
Cherubim and seraphim thronged the air
But His mother only, in her maiden bliss
Worshiped the beloved with a kissWhat can I give Him, poor as I am?
If I were a shepherd, I would bring a lamb
If I were a wise man, I would do my part
What I can, I give Him, give my heartWhat can I give Him, poor as I am?
If I were a shepherd, I would bring a lamb
If I were a wise man, I would do my part
What I can, I give Him, give my heart 
The snow has fallen like it does every year
The tree I know so well is aglow
And folks are filled up with the usual holiday cheer
As they hang pretty lights and mistletoeOh, but this year is different for you and for me
Our own little miracle on our own little street
Never before have I loved 'Silent Night' so
But now that you're here by my sideBaby it is, baby it is
It really is a wonderful lifeI'd never noticed that the crackle of a fire
Makes music when accompanied by a kiss
And when did I start having dreams about pumpkin pies?
Well, there's not a lot that's sweeter than thisOh, but this year is better for you and for me
Our own little miracle on our own little street
Never before have I loved 'Silent Night' so
But now that you're here by my sideBaby it is, baby it is
It really is a wonderful lifeOh, but this year is better for you and for me
Our own little miracle on our own little street
Never before have I loved 'Silent Night' so
But now that you're here by my side
Darling with you, by my sideBaby it is, baby it is
It really is a wonderful life 
They said, some men would be warriors
Some men would be kings
Some men would be owners of land
And other man-made thingsFalse love as the eternal flame
Would move some to think in rings
And gold would be our power
And other foolish thingsAnd you who dream of liberty
Must not yourselves be fooled
Before you get to plea for freedom
You've agreed to being ruledIf the body stays in shackle
Then the mind remains a chain
That will link you to your destiny
By other souls are slainIt won't take long
It won't take too long at allThree men in a desert, wandering
One is knowing and two are scared
They say time is in the river
Oh, but the river is not thereDry in spirit, dry in body
Two will lend themselves to death
And in grief, one weeps into his hands
And drinks his bitter tears'Cause it don't take long
It don't take too long at all, no, it don't take long
You might say, "I don't know what you're talking about"
And I say, "You mean to tell me, that's all"And I stand before you now
I am hopeful in my rage
You know, love has finally called for me
I will not wilt upon it's stageBut you know, still smaller than my nightmare
Now, do I print upon the page?
And do we have to live inside it's walls
To identify the cage'Cause it takes so long
Why does it take so long? And it takes so long
You might say, "I don't really care what you're talking about"
I'm gonna ask you, you trying to tell me, you don't belongI am my mother's daughter
I have seen myself in you
It's this blessing that I follow, now
So I must be trueI dreamed of thousands dying
It was you and you and you
And while the city sleeps so quietly
There is something we must doAnd it won't take long, it won't take too long at all
It won't take long, I might say
I don't know if I wanna know what you're getting at
It makes me wanna say, "So long"Grief shall come in measures
Only grief alone will know
And you'll see it on your family
And on your own face, it will growThen, they'll try to keep you hungry
And they'll tell you to eat snow
You know, pride can be a moving thing
If we learn the strength of noAnd it won't take long
It won't take too long at all
No, it won't take long
You may say, "I don't think this has anything to do with me"
Did you ever think, you could be wrong?At noon, on one day coming
Human strength will fill the streets
Of every city on our planet
Hear the sound of angry feetWith business freezed up in the harbour
The kings will pull upon their hair
And the banks will shudder to a halt
And the artists will be there'Cause it won't take long
It won't take too long at all, no it won't take long
And you may say, "I don't think I can be a part of that"
And it makes me want to say
"Don''t you want to see yourself that strong"Division between the peoples
Will disappear that honored day
And though oceans lie between us
Lifted candles light the wayHalf will join their hands by moonlight
The rest under the rising sun
As underneath the sun and moon
A ritualed wailing has begunAnd it won't take long, it won't take too long at all
And it won't take long, and you may say
"I don't know how to be a part of what you're talking about"
And it makes me want to say, "Come on, come on"And beware, you sagging diplomats
For you will not hear one gun
And though our homes be torn and ransacked
We will not be undoneFor as we let ourselves be bought
We're gonna let ourselves be free
And if you think we stand alone
Take a look around, and you will seeWe are children in the rafters
We are babies in the park
We are lovers at the movies
We are candles in the darkWe are changes in the weather
We are snowflakes in July
We are women grown together
We are men who easily cryWe are words not quickly spoken
We're the deeper side of try
We are dreamers in the making
We are not afraid of why 
It's alright forty days of rain
My skin stretched out from the growing pain
It'd be nice to have an explanation
But it's alrightAnd it's alright if you hate that way
Hate me 'cause I'm different
You hate me 'cause I'm gay
Truth of the matter come around one day
It's alrightI look at this lifeline stretched way all across my hand
I look at the burned out empty like a plague across the land
And for everything I learn there are two I don't understand
That's while I'm still on a search
Through the weather strewn church
I'm doing the best that I can
And it's alrightAnd it's alright though we worry and fuss (alright)
We can't get over the hump or get over us (we can't get over us)
It seems easier to push than to let go and trust (alright)
But it's alrightWhen we get a little distant some things get clearer
Yeah give 'em the space some hearts grow nearer
I ran as hard as I could I still ended up here
And it's alrightAs I look at this lifeline stretched way all across my hand (lifeline all across my hand)
I look at the fires of hatred (fire)
Burning up the bounty of this beautiful land (burning up the land)
I know that I'm small in a way but I know I'm strong
And it's my thirst that brought me to the water
Well I give it all up then she carries me on
It's alrightYeahAnd it's alright if I feel afraid
My plans in pieces
My plans mislaid
It's the will of the way (the will of the way)
The will of the way (it's the will of the way)
The will of the only way that could have brought me here today
And it's alrightAnd it's alright 
Stayed in bed all morning just to pass the time
There's something wrong here there can be no denying
Now one of us is changing
Or maybe we've just stopped tryingBut it's too late baby, now it's too late
Though we really did try to make it
Something inside has died and I can't hide
And I just can't fake it
NoIt used to be so easy living here with you
You were light and breezy I knew just what to do
But now you look so unhappy and I feel like a foolBut it's too late baby, now it's too late
Though we really did try to make it
Something inside has died and I can't hide
And I just can't fake it
NoThere'll be good times again for me and you
But we just can't stay together don't you see that it's true
Still I'm glad for what we had
And how I once loved youBut it's too late baby, now it's too late
Though we really did try to make it
Something inside has died and I can't hide
And I just can't fake it
It's too late baby
It's too late now darling
It's too late

As the sun turned red from yellow
And the crowd they heard him haltingAnd they sighed with much relief
The preacher asked him for any last words
My brother spit on to his clean shirt
And he smiled without redemption
And said this is one soul God don't needOh yes I loved him but I won't miss him
As he's burning and he's twisting
For his heartless dedication
To the devil and it's creed
Oh as a child we called him rottenTill he was lonely and forgotten

Dancin'}I left my anger in a river runnin' highway five
New Hampshire, Vermont, bordered by
College farms, hubcaps and fallin' rocks
Voices in the woods and the mountaintopsI used to search for reservations and native lands
Before I realized everywhere I stand
There have been tribal feet runnin' wild as fire
Past life sister of my desireJonas and Ezekial hear me now, said
"Steady now and don't come out
I'm not ready for the dead to show its face
Whose turn is it anyway?
Anyway"Now when I was young my people taught me well
Give back what you take or you'll go to hell
It's not the Devil's land, you know it's not that kind
Every devil I meet becomes a friend of mine
Every devil I meet is an angel in disguiseJonas and Ezekial hear me now
"Steady now and don't come out
I'm not ready for the dead to show its face
Whose angel are you anyway?"Ha ha huh huh
Ha ha huh huh
Haa haa woo
Haa wooWhite, chain, rope, fear
(Hush my baby)
Be still my dear
(Be still my dear)A bullet in the head, now he's dead
A friend of a friend, someone said
He was an activist with a very short life
I think there's a lesson here he died without a fightIn the war over land where the world began
Prophecies say it's where the world will end
There's a tremor growin' in our own backyard
Fear in our heads and fear in our hearts
Prophets in the graveyard
(Prophets in the graveyard)Jonas and Ezekial hear me now
"Steady now and don't come out
I'm not ready for the dead to show its face
Whose turn is it anyway?"I said, "Jonas and Ezekial hear me now
(Jonas, Ezekial)
Steady now I feel your ghost about
(Steady now)
I'm not ready for the dead to show its face
(I'm not ready for the dead to show its face)
Whose angel are you anyway?"I said, "There's prophets in the graveyard
(Now I walk in beauty)
Prophets in the graveyard
(Beauty is before me)
Prophets in the graveyard
(Beauty is behind me)
(Above and below me)"{Thanks

Junkie's lamentRikki's been kicking the gong
Lickety split didn't take too long
A junkies sick a monkeys strong
That's what's wrongWell I guess he's been messing around down town
So sad to see the man losing ground
He's winding down behind closed doors
On all foursMama don't you call him my name
He can't hear you anymore
And even if he seems the same to you
That's a stranger to your door
Go on ask him what's he come here forOh my God a monkey can move a man
Send him to hell and home again
With an empty hand in the afternoon
Shooting for the moonHe's halfway sick and it's halfway stoned
He'd sure like to quit but he's too far far gone
And they'll wind him down with the methadone
He's all on his ownBaby don't you throw your love away
I hate to seem unkind
It's only that I understand the man
That the monkey can leave behind
And I used to think he was a friend of mine 
She was grasping for a way to tell us all
The hurt she felt inside
We're all too happy she says
"let's have a war"
And the night digs deeper inThey're just some words to pass the time
Some words to pass the timeNow when the silence gets to be too much
I can feel the soul searching
Where do I go when I've lost my cause
We are the stories
Even the good ones let me down
There all just words to pass the timeI used to be so sincere
And maybe I still am
And all this small talk I've been reeling off
Is slowly getting out of handI mix real feelings
With the ones I wish I had
And I catch the most important ones
In between them all
Sometimes it seems like they're all just words
To pass the timeAnd then we've lost our time
And we've wasted out words
And all the strain is gone
Sometimes it's too unreal to believe
Just don't give it all away
Get a grip
Causes sometimes there are just words to pass the timeI said I'm too high I'm too high
And I'm scared of falling down
I've just been grasping for words
To make you want to stay
To make it worthwhile
I don't want spend the rest of my life
Just passing time
I don't want to spend the rest of my life here
Just passing time 
For you I would tattoo me
With lines crossin' into a hand
And a heart that would never bleed
With the twilight and the horse drawn on my arm
Standing for an addiction, pray we go unharmedHere is my love and anger
You see now, these are my Gods
These are my scars
Here is, here is my love and anger
Well, these arms are burnin' but they're open wideSome things I hold too tightly
Some things I'll never, I'll never touch
Oh, but I'm wearing down the stones in the river
And you see all my life I painted with anger's brushNow, now could you lift me through my love and anger
You see now, these are your Gods
These are my scars
Lift me through my love and anger
Oh, and my arms are burnin' but they're open wideOh, you precious kid, kid
I have a motion, and it's just for you
I see a warrior, barefoot and dancin'
Oh, with tears of pain and beauty, and all of this is trueFor you, lift me through my love and anger
You see now, these are my Gods
These are your scars
Lift me, through my love and anger
Oh, and my arms are burnin' and they're open widePointing out the graveyards I will be the reaper
If you will be the keeper of my heart
I will be the reaper if you will be the keeper
You are the keeper of this heart, of my heart

Who is counting sleepless nights?
Who is counting letters I meant to write?
Who is counting at all?
If you are, I look pretty small
-chorus-
But no matter what I do
If I couldn't be call you mine
If I couldn't be with you
I'd just be killing time
You went searching for me in the night sky
And when I burned away, you wondered why
Well, I'll tell you, babe, I could not bear to stall
I fell too fast, I fell too far
-chorus-
Big, big fishes in little ponds
I've seen them walk around with magic wands
-chorus-
There ain't no magician hidden inside of me
So no matter what you hear, I hope you see
That just when I'm trying to be tall
That's when I end up looking pretty small
-chorus-
No matter what I do
(And you know I will burn)
If I couldn't be call you mine
(Like a star in the sky)
If I couldn't be with you
(All I'd be doing is)
I'd just be killing time
-chorus- 
"Knockin' on Heaven's Door" is a Bob Dylan song from 1973. The girls
have been doing it now and then since at least 1988. There's
something about the girls' version that kinda confuses me... See,
the official Dylan lyric sheet has two verses:
Mama, take this badge off of me
I can't use it anymore
It's getting dark, too dark for me to see
I feel like I'm knockin' on heaven's door
Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven's door...
Mama, put my guns in the ground
I can't shoot them anymore
That long black cloud is comin' down
I feel like I'm knockin' on heaven's door
Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven's door...
Though I know that Dylan often sings a third verse live:
Mama, wipe the blood from my face
I can't see through it anymore
It's a feeling that I just can't trace
I feel like I'm knockin' on heaven's door
Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven's door...
Though in every IG version I have, Amy sings the following third
verse:
Mama, wipe this blood from my face
I can't see through the walls
Six white horses coming to carry me away
I feel like I'm knockin' on heaven's door
Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven's door...
So, I don't know whether Amy re-wrote Dylan's third verse, or whether
it's from some Dylan version I don't know. What I'm trying to say is
that I don't know whether to attribute the "six white horses" line to
Dylan or to Amy.
To further complicate matters, I've got one version that features a
FOURTH verse, sung by Michelle Malone. This verse breaks both the
meter and the rhyme scheme (ABBB in favor of ABAB), so I'm willing to
bet that it's just Ms. Malone improvising...
Mama, take these chains off of me
'Cause I don't want them anymore
They're getting too damn heavy, I'm crawling across the floor
I feel like I'm knockin' on heaven's door
Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven's door...
Oh - BTW - the first person who asks me about the "Guns-n-Roses"
version will feel my wrath...
-Vic.

I don't know if it was real or in a dream
Lately waking up I'm not sure where I've been
There was a table set for six and five were there
I stood outside and kept my eyes upon that empty chairAnd there was steam on the windows from the kitchen
Laughter like a language I once spoke with ease
But I'm made mute by the virtue of decision
And I choose most of your life goes on without meOh the fear I've known
That I might reap the praise of strangers
And end up on my own
All I've sown was a song but maybe I was wrongI said to you the one gift which I'd adore
The package of the next 10 years unfolding
But you told me if I had my way I'd be bored
Right then I knew I loved you best born of your scoldingWhen we last talked we were lying on our backs
Looking up at the sky through the ceiling
I used to lie like that alone out on the driveway
Trying to read the Greek upon the stars the alphabet of feelingOh, I knew back then
It was a calling that said "If joy then pain"
The sound of the voice these years later
Is still the sameI am alone in a hotel room tonight
I squeeze the sky out but there's not a star appears
Begin my studies with this paper and this pencil
And I'm working through the grammar of my fearsOh, mercy what I won't give
To have the things that mean the most
Not to mean the things I miss
Unforgiving the choice still is the language or the kiss 
These are the last tears I'm gonna cry for you
My cryin's through, I'm moving on
I don't regret and won't forget
A single thing that we went through
But these are the last tears I'm gonna cry for youYou take things so much easier than I do
And you could live your life without me if you had to
And you believe that in the end it all works out right
And I might, if not for youAnd if you ask one which one lives just alone for love
I doBut these are the last tears I'm gonna cry for you
My cryin's through, I'm moving on
I don't regret and won't forget
A single thing that we went through
But these are the last tears I'm gonna cry for youThere was a time when all signs pointed to the warm south
The planets all lined up and built a new house
And everything we talked about felt like a prophecy
And when you looked at me they all came trueAnd if you asked which one wants to go the distance
I doBut these are the last tears I'm gonna cry for you
My cryin's through, I'm moving on
I don't regret and won't forget
A single thing that we went through
But there are the last tears I'm gonna cry for youI'm gonna rack my mind one last time until I cannot think
I'm gonna dip into your memory and take a good stiff drink
And when I'm drunk on the last drop of sadness
About how we went wrongI'm gonna play this song
Make some coffee black and strong
Give thanks for healing time
Finally make up my mindThese are the last tears I'm gonna cry for you
Baby, my cryin's through, I'm moving on
I don't regret and won't forget
A single thing that we went through
But there are the last tears I'm gonna cry for youThese are the last tears, Im gonna cry for you 
Ohh, the party's kicked up a few notches
Look at us getting loose
She leans back against the wall and she watches
Tugging her collar like it might be a nooseAnd everyones tied to their thing
To their past or their drink
Or the date that they bring
I just get tired all of sudden taking it inAnd I want to lay my head down on you
Because you're the only solid thing in this room
A room full of changes, strangers, illusion, confusion
I speak from my heart but I'm not really sure if it's true
I wanna lay my head down on youOhh, consider waste, too much time planning
Or you'll get the rug ripped out
And the only way you'll be satisfied
Is learning to live withoutBut some plan for the kingdom of heaven
And some take their chances and bet lucky seven
I don't know what to believe
I just show up and breathe anymoreAnd I wanna lay my head down on you
Because you're the only solid thing in this room
A room full of dressers, professors, lookers, hookers
If I don't get out, I'll do something I don't wanna do
And I wanna lay my head down on youWas it so long ago
That we sat and talked in your car?
Your things were all packed
And the place you were headed, not really that farYears later I think
That I would have been much more alive
To have taken you up on your offer
And taken that driveOhh, well, everything that's come before us
Leads us to where we are now
And thats simple, I know so why can't I let go of the feeling
That I'm lost somehowI'm just a ghost looking in
Out of my own life just visiting
In search of a body to have
And to hold and to keep and to sleepI wanna lay my head down on you
Because you're the only solid thing in this room
A room full of missed chance, slow dance, cold fate, heartache
I showed up for a party and saw my life story full view
And I wanna lay my head down on you 
 
Jet fuel and traffic lines
Pulling up to the delta signs
Distant shape of my hometown
Black stain where the wheels touch downI pick up the morning news
I pass the man who's never shined my shoes
Through security and to the train
That will take me to the aeroplaneCount the miles on the highway
The sum of all my days
There's a postcard, there's a call
And there's a picture for your bedroom wallBut do you ever wonder through and through?
Who's that person standing next to you?
And after all the nights apart
Is there a home for a traveling heartBut if I weren't leaving you
I don't know what I would do
But the more I go, the less I know
Will the fire still burn on my return?
Keep the path lit on the only road I know
Honey, all I know to do is goA cup of coffee and my bags are packed
The same vow not to look back
Familiar emptiness inside
As the distances grow wideAnd though I vow to memorize
The last look in your loving eyes
It's here dusk and there dawn
Oh it's like a curtain getting slowly drawnBut if I weren't leaving you
I don't know what I would do
But the more I go, the less I know
Will the fire still burn on my return?
Keep the path lit on the only road I know
Honey, all I know to do is goBut if I weren't leaving you
I don't know what I would do
But the more I go it seems the less I know
Will the fire still burn on my return
Keep the path lit on the only road I know
Honey, all I know to do is go 
It's dark at 4 pm in Leeds
The steeples pierce the skylight till the last of it bleeds
The absent sound of another day as it recedes
Into the shadows until it's nothingFax papers slipped under the hotel room door
Like food for the prisoner or the prospect to the whore
Well fed and halfway drunk I ache myself for more
Until I'm shadows of myself, until I'm nothingSixteen black churches burning on the TV
All the way from Texas to Tennessee
And a politician locks my eye and says to me
There is no crisis here there's no conspiracyI crave inertia every move made so I can stop
Whatever this madness is in me spinning like a top
On a bed of anxiety over a deep dark drop
Down into nothingness into without younessWas it ever so the evil creep like ivy
A toe hold on the stronger half of nature's dichotomy
I'm beating back a path through nothing more than pure insistence
Until here becomes the distanceHold my head love I'm sick tonight
Find the open hole and press your fingers there with all your might
Before the last ounce of my spirit bleeds
Onto the pristine sheets of the hotel bed in Leeds 
Everybody loves you and they want to know your story
You go riding out a mystery, concealed in all your glory
But when it comes to flesh and bones, you remind me of shallot
Only made of shadows even though you're notI remember how I spent all my energy and time
With affected conversation I was trying to pry inside your mind
You are as beautiful as truth and as empty as a shell
But I came to you one night and it made me feel like hellOh, to reach through all your surface just to find an empty pool
And to suffer all your pride as I lay down by your side
And you swallowed up my heart and left me a fool
Left me a foolEverybody loves a hero, an image to create
Antithesis of everything, inside ourselves we hate
But you'd better close your eyes when it's time for them to die
Because you'd hate to think the life you'd built upon them was a lieOh, to reach through all your surface just to find an empty pool
And to suffer all your pride as I lay down by your side
And you swallowed up my heart and left me a fool
Left me a foolI resign myself to silence, I will never blow your cover
No one ever has to know who the hero took for lover
But it comes to mind as you blaze on as brilliant as a star
How many you've left behind?
How many casualties there are?Oh, to reach through all your surface just to find an empty pool
And to suffer all your pride as I lay down by your side
And you swallowed up my heart and left me a fool
Left me a fool 
Sticks and stones
Battle zones
A single light bulb
On a single thread for the blackSirens wail
History fails
Rose colored glass
Begins to age and crackWhile the politicians shadowbox
The power ring
In an endless split decision
Never solve anything
From a neighbor's distant land
I heard the strain of the common manLet it be me
(This is not a fighting song)
Let it be me
(Not a wrong for a wrong)
Let it be me
If the world is night
Shine my life like a lightWell the world seems spent
And the president
Has no good idea
Of who the masses areWell I'm one of them
And I'm among friends
We're trying to see beyond
The fences in our own backyardsI've seen the kingdoms blow
Like ashes in the winds of change
Yeah but the power of truth
Is the fuel for the flame
So the darker the ages get
There's a stronger beacon yetLet it be me
(This is not a fighting song)
Let it be me
(Not a wrong for a wrong)
Let it be me
If the world is night
Shine my life like a lightIn the kind word you speak
In the turn of the cheek
(In the turn of the cheek)
When your vision stays clear
In the face of your fear
(In the face of your fear)Then you see turning out a light switch
Is their only power
When we stand like spotlights
In a mighty tower
All for one and one for all
Then we sing the common callLet it be me
(This is not a fighting song)
Let it be me
(Not a wrong for a wrong)
Let it be me
If the world is night
Shine my life like a light 
Come pleasure me again
I'm so tired of digging in
I've done my share, don't need to win
Just let me go easyFor two years my body fights
At this point it don't seem right
Just to do it out of spite
And keep hanging onGo on, you let me go easy
Won't you let me go easy?
You let me go right nowI see the numbers dwindling
Of my enemies and of my friends
And still I know it never ends
So I'm passing you this torchFight the greed and the federals
Fight the need and the toxic spills
You drink from that wishing well
But may it never quench your thirstLet me go easy
Go on, you let me go easy
Won't you let me go easy?
You let me go right nowLet me go easy
Go on, you let me go easy
Won't you let me go easy?
You let me go right nowSo when you get to Ladenville
'Fore the tears, the fare thee wells
For a moment stand real still
And you'll feel me moving onYou go ahead with your plans
You won't be seeing me again
But you'll feel me in the hand
The hand that holds the ploughLet me go easy
Go on, you let me go easy
Won't you let me go easy?
You let me go right now.Let me go easy
Go on, you let me go easy
Won't you let me go easy?
You let me go right now

Just one more illusion
Oh, Pacem in terres me shanti shalom aywah 
"Lifeblood" is an Emily Saliers song from the 1986 Indigo Girls EP.
I think the last time I heard it performed live was March of 1990.
I'm transcribing the lyrics straight off of the lyric sheet from the
EP, not from the song itself.
Another night in a successsion
Thinly glued with beer and wine
It's a precarious profession
Every day at work sees your heart on the line
Maybe I should have gone to business school
Or gained myself a respectable trade
Or stayed in childhood where the shade keeps you cool
Making my living selling lemonade
Chorus:
-
But running through my veins
Are the words and the refrains
As if they were my lifeblood itself
And I can't stay alive on the food of 9 to 5
If my dreams were just old pictures on the shelf
-
I remember the folks said give it a try
Or you'll never know who you might have been
And just remember, nothing is the end of the world
Until the world comes to an end
Still, there's a point to this philosophy
Of taking a look at who you are
Still sometimes all I have to help me see
Are all the mirrors behind the bar

"Life's So Strange" is an Emily Saliers song. The only performance I
have of it is from Carboro, North Carolina, on 21 March 1988.
Stylistically, it seems to fit pretty tightly into that time period,
so I don't think it was written too much earlier than that.
Cold black coffee, incessant stream of cars
Cigarette ash lies sprinkled like a fistful of grey stars
Yesterday it rained silver rainbows on the ground
Today the rain's just water - it won't stop from falling down.
I get weary waiting for my muse
But in between the times she comes
I still have to tie my shoes
And get on with my day
There are mornings when I'm with (?)
And there are days I have to take the bus.
Life's so rich...
Life's so empty...
Secret rendezvous, long distance from a phone booth
Like two players in a mystery straight out of our youth
Well I'm finding that dramatics have lost their old appeal
I play the part of stoic lover, but I'm not sure how I feel
I get discouraged waiting for the world
To understand this love affair
To understand the girl
There are mornings when Amelia's right beside me
The next thing I know, I taste the salt of the sea.
Life's so rich...
Life's so empty...
Cold black coffee, incessant stream of cars
Cigarette ash lies sprinkled like a fistful of grey stars
Yesterday it rained silver rainbows on the ground
Today the rain's just water - it won't stop from falling down.
As I grow weary, I'm waiting for the world
To understand this love affair
To understand the girl
There are mornings when Amelia's right beside me
The next thing I know, I taste the salt of the sea.
Life's so rich...
Life's so empty...
Life's so strange. 
Cold black coffee, incessant stream of cars
Cigarette ash lies sprinkled like a fistful of grey stars
Yesterday it rained silver rainbows on the ground
Today the rain's just water - it won't stop from falling down.
I get weary waiting for my muse
But in between the times she comes
I still have to tie my shoes
And get on with my day
There are mornings when I'm with (?)
And there are days I have to take the bus.
Life's so rich...
Life's so empty...
Secret rendezvous, long distance from a phone booth
Like two players in a mystery straight out of our youth
Well I'm finding that dramatics have lost their old appeal
I play the part of stoic lover, but I'm not sure how I feel
I get discouraged waiting for the world
To understand this love affair
To understand the girl
There are mornings when Amelia's right beside me
The next thing I know, I taste the salt of the sea.

Life's so rich...
Life's so empty...
Life's so strange 
Couple in the next room's bound to win a prize
Cause they've been going at it all night long
And I'm trying to get some sleep
But these motel walls are cheap
And lincoln duncan is my name
And here's my song
And here's my songMy father was a fisherman my mom a fisherman's friend
And I was born in the boredom and the chowder
When I reached my prime
I left my home in the maritimes
And i, I headed down the turnpike
For new england
Sweet new englandHad holes in my confidence
And holes in the knees of my jeans
And I was left without a penny in my pocket
And ew-whee I was desitute as a girl could be
And I wished I wore a ring so I could hock it
I'd surely hock itI met a young girl in the parking lot
She was preaching to the crowd
By singing sacred songs and reading from the bible
Well I told her I was lost
And she told me all about the penticost
And I seen that girl as a road to my survivalLater on the very same night
She crept to my tent with a flashlight
And these long years of innocence ended
Took me to the woods
I said her comes something that feels so good
And just like a dog I was befriended
I was befriendedI said what a night
What a garden of delight
Even now that sweet memory lingers
I was lying under the stars just playing my guitar
But I was thanking the lord for my fingers
For my fingersI know I know I know I know
I know I know 
Hey little darling
There's something that you should know
This things gonna hound every soul
This thing they won't let us go
Gonna break us down to nothing
Gonna eat us from the inside out
Hey little darling
I don't want you to feeling the falloutAh when the cancer finally took him
I was watching the trucks pull in
Me and your daddy we had a job
Under the ground mining uranium
Some things your daddy leaves you
Some things he don't
Some things are gonna be here anyhow
And some things just won't
One thing I want you to understand
Is you ain't gotta be no mining man
I curse the day that I went down
And I pulled that shit out of the groundNow we were living over in nevada
That's where your people come from
Your grandma would take me and your daddy
On down to the gunnery range
We sit and watch the bombs blow
Until the sun goes down
All those colors running like the painted desert
And you get to see it nowThem government boys have something so damn secret
They had to hide it in the desert sand
Out there the skies so big
And there ain't no mistaking it
Whose got the winning handAh
Ah ah ah ahI said I've been all the way to alaska
To a town they call point of hope
Where they took some of what we got down here
Just to see how it would grow
I hear the lichen bought it
And now it's running through the caribou
I said soon little darling
You'll get to feel it too
Get to feel it too
Oh I said soon little darling
You'll get to feel it to
Hmm hmm hmm yeah
Oh yeah hmm hmm
Hmm hmm hmm
Oh yeah hmm hmm
Hmm hmm hmm 
Back in the long stretch of loneliness
I have come to call a living
I'm getting something for all this love's labor
Even when I am forgettingWhee and ohh, whee, ohh, ohh, whee little perennials
(Whee, whee, whee, whee)
Where'd you come from?Daughter of my father's second cousin
Loyalties, I got 'em by the dozen
We shared a past, we share a blood relation
And that's as good as an invitationWhee and ohh, whee, ohh, ohh, whee, little perennials
(Whee, whee, whee, whee)
Where'd you come from?
(Whee, whee, whee, whee)And ohh, whee, ohh, ohh, little perennials
(Whee, whee, whee, whee)
Where'd you come from?
(Whee)I'm in the North Carolina mountains
Just to the west of where I met my calling
If you look south, foothills of these mountains risingThat's the place where it feels good falling
That's the place where it feels good falling
That's the place that I know
(Feels good falling)I look for words to fill the empty spaces
All the life revealed in these back stages
I reach for names like little puzzle pieces
Ohh, perennial, come to meWhee and ohh, whee, ohh, ohh, whee, little perennials
(Whee, whee, whee, whee)
Where'd you come from?
(Whee, whee, whee, whee)And ohh, whee, ohh, ohh, little perennials
(Whee, whee, whee, whee)
Where'd you come from? 
Long ago a young man sits
And plays his waiting game
But things are not the same it seems
As in such tender dreamsSlowly passing sailing ships
On sunday afternoon
Like the people on the moon I've seen
Are things not meant to beWhere do those golden rainbows end
(where do the rainbows end)
Why is this song so sad
(why is this song so sad)
Dreaming the dreams I dream my friend
(dreaming the dreams I dream)
Loving the love I loveTo love is just a word I've heard
When things are being said
Stories my poor head has told me
Can not stand the coldAnd in between what might have been
And what has come to pass
Are misbegotten guests alas
And bits of broken glassWhere do your golden rainbows end
(where do the rainbows end)
Why is the song I sing so sad
(why is this song so sad)
Dreaming the dreams I dream my friend
(dreaming the dreams I dream)
Loving the love I love
To love to love to loveWhere do your golden rainbows end
(where do the rainbows end)
Why is the song I sing so sad
(why is this song so sad)
Dreaming the dreams I dream my friend
(dreaming the dreams I dream)
Loving the love I love
To love to love to love
Whoa no no no no no 
"Losin' Touch" is an Amy Ray song from "Color Me Grey."
Losin' Touch.
Here I am, shooting for the sky
You say you've settled in
Yeah, well, I guess that's good for you
But I'm still trying to tear myself free
Well, I could take it or leave it,
That's what I've said to myself
Then I start to tremble
And I'm lost to a powerless cause
I'm losin' touch
Sometimes my memories, they just seem to fade fast away
I've been losing too much
Losing the feel for the dreams I once thought I had
'Cause sometimes I feel like they're all circling around
They keep calling to me, and I keep falling down
I'd rather be alone and lonely lying on the ground
Than in those grips again
They're so cruel
Taught me to fly, then they stole my sky
They taught me to love
Then they broke me down 'till there was nothing left but emptiness
And don't you ever feel like they're all circling around
They keep calling to me, and I keep falling down
I'd rather be alone and lonely lying on that ground
Than in those grips again
Well, I could take it, I could leave it, you know, hah,
That's what I've said to myself
I've been down there so many times, you know
And it hurts like nothing else
"Cause I'm losin' touch
I've been slippin' away, I've been losin' too much. 
Here I am
Shooting for the sky
You say you've settled in
Yeah well I guess that's good for you
But I'm still trying to tear myself free
Well I could take it or leave it
You know that's what I've said to myself
But then I start to tremble
And I'm lost to a powerless causeI'm losing touch
Sometimes my memories
They just seem to fade fast away
I've been losing too much
Losing the feel for the dreams I once thought I had
Sometimes I feel like they're all circling around
They keep calling to me and I keep falling down
I'd rather be alone and lonely lying on the ground
Than in those grips againThey're so cruel
Taught me to fly
Then they stole my sky
Taught me to love
Then they broke me down
Till there was nothing left but emptiness
And don't you ever feel like they're all circling around
They keep calling to me and I keep falling down
I'd rather be alone and lonely lying on that ground
Than in those grips againWell I could take it I could leave it you know hah
That's what I've said to myself
I've been down there so many times you know
And it hurts like nothing else
Cause I'm losing touch
I've been slipping away
I've been losing too much 
Guess I wasn't the best one to ask
Me myself with my face pressed
Up against love's glass
To see the shiny toy I've been hoping for
The one I never can afford
The wide world spins and spits turmoil
And the nations toil for peace
But the paws of fear upon your chest
Only love can soothe that beast
And my words are paper tigers
No match for the predators of pain inside herI say love will come to you
Hoping just because I spoke the words that they're true
As if I offered up a crystal ball to look through
Where there's now one there will be twoI was born under the sign of cancer (love will come to you)
Like brushing cloth I smooth the wrinkles for an answer (love will come)
And I'm always closing my eyes and wishing I'm fine (I close my eyes and wish you fine)
Even though I know I'm not this time (even though I know your not this time)And I say love will come to you
Hoping just because I spoke the words that they're true
As if I offered up a crystal ball to look through
Where there's now one there will be twoDodging your memories a field of knives
Always on the outside looking in on other's livesI say love will come to you
Hoping just because I spoke the words that they're true
As if I offered up a crystal ball to look through (I have offered up to you)
Where there's now one there will be twoAnd I wish her insight to battle love's blindness
Strength from the milk of human kindness
A safe place for all the pieces that scattered
Learn to pretend there's more than love that matters 
I opened my hands up to see what I've got
My days slip like coins into a slot
They are gone
The shadows lie longI've been banking on a broken machine
Left unattended like most of my dreams
Rusted components of an unmarked songWe've been staring down a brilliant dream
The sun burns our eyes
We've been fighting for the love of our livesAll around us things come apart
Broken pieces broken hearts
Fix me oil me match me with the next best thingPerson to person nation to nation
Heels dug in no communication
While the time speaks of weatheringWe've been wanting to be helped by binding ties
We've been fighting for the love of our livesAnd when it breaks down I beg you don't go
A sinking ship I'm ready to blow
I try to outthink you with an army of words
I strategize
I am fighting for the love of my lifeFire and water oxygen
Scotch and soda or any combination
Starts the reactionIs there no mastermind of modern day
Who can blueprint a plan to make love stay
steady and weatherproof usher in a new revolution?After trying more the hopeful ones still try
How can we help it
When we're fighting for the love of our live?(Trying more) The Hopeful ones still try
How can we help it
When we're fighting for the love of our lives? 
Living on free food tickets
There's water in the milk from a hole in the roof
Where the rain came through
What can you do?
You've got tears from your little sister
Crying 'cause she doesn't have a dress without a patch
For the party to go
But you know she's gonna get by.
-chorus-
Living in the love of the common people
Smiles from the heart of a family man
Daddy's gonna buy you a dream to cling to
Momma's gonna love you just as much as she can
And she can.
It's a good thing you don't have bus fare
It would fall through the hole in your pocket
And you'd lose it the snow on the ground
You better walk to town and find a job.
And you try to keep your hands warm
But the hole in your shoe lets the snow come through
And it chills you to the bone
You better go home, where it's warm.
-chorus-
Living on a dream ain't easy
But the closer the knit, the tighter the fit
And the chills stay away
We like to keep them in stride with family pride.
Faith is your foundation
Got a whole lot of love and a warm conversation
But don't forget to pray
It's keeping us strong where we belong.
-chorus-
Living in the love of the common people
(...You know that faith is your foundation)
Smiles from the heart of a family man
(...Little bit of love and a warm conversation)
Daddy's gonna buy you a dream to cling to
(...Don't forget to pray, it's keeping us strong)
Momma's gonna love you just as much as she can
(...Where we belong)
Living in the love of the common people
(...Oh, living on a dream ain't easy)
Smiles from the heart of a family man
(...But the closer the knit, the tighter the fit)
Daddy's gonna buy you a dream to cling to
(...We like to keep 'em in stride)
Momma's gonna love you just as much as she can
(...Family pride)
And she can 
Love the one you're with
When you're down and confused
And you don't remember who you're talking to
Consentration gonna slip away
Cause your baby is so far awayHoney there's a rose in the fisted glove
And the eagle flies with the dove
If you can't be with the one you love
Honey love the one you're with
Love the one you're with
Love the one you're withDon't be angry and don't be sad
Don't sit crying over bad times you've had
Cause there's a girl sitting next to you
And she's just waiting for something to doHoney there's a rose in the fisted glove
And the eagle flies with the dove
If you can't be with the one you love
Honey love the one you're with
Love the one you're with
Love the one you're with
Do do do do do do do do
Do do do do do do do do
Do do do do do do do do
Do do do
Do do doTurn your heartache right into joy
There's a girl honey you're a boy
Well you get it together gonna make it nice
You ain't gonna need any more adviceHoney there's a rose in the fisted glove
And the eagle flies with the dove
If you can't be with the one you love
Honey love the one you're with
Love the one you're with
Love the one you're with
Do do do do do do do do
Do do do do do do do do
Do do do do do do do do
Do do do
Do do do 
During the time of which I speak it was hard to turn the other cheek
To the blows of insecurity
Feeding the cancer of my intellect the blood of love soon neglected
Lay dying in the strength of its impurity
Meanwhile our friends we thought were so together
They've all gone and left each other in search of fairer weather
And we sit here in our storm and drink a toast
To the slim chance of love's recoveryThere I am in younger days, star gazing
Painting picture perfect maps of how my life and love would be
Not counting the unmarked paths of misdirection
My compass, faith in love's perfection
I missed ten million miles of road I should have seen
Meanwhile our friends we thought were so together
Left each other one by one along the road of fairer weather
And we sit here in our storm and drink a toast
To the slim chance of love's recoveryRain soaked and voice choked like silent screaming in a dream
I search for our absolute distinction
Not content to bow and bend
To the whims of culture that swoop like vultures
Eating us away, eating us away
Eating us away to our extinction
Oh how I wish I were a trinity, so if I lost a part of me
I'd still have two of the same to live
But nobody gets a lifetime rehearsal, as specks of dust we're universal
To let this love survive would be the greatest gift that we could give
Tell all the friends who think they're so together
That these are ghosts and mirages, all these thoughts of fairer weather
Though it's storming out I feel safe within the arms of love's discovery 
I'm in search of greener pastures
Don't like my garden's what I said
Although I'm working harder than last year
I'm still deep in the redI am rowing as hard as I can
And they're selling me up a stream
I'm always a one more step away
From the American dreamI got a chip on my shoulder
About the size of a mental block
And I've got someone on the telephone
Trying to sell me a future in stockMaybe I work too hard to be happy
And I should practice letting go
But it's hard not to rock the boat
When you're sailing against the undertowI want to slide into the black
And wear the black mask
I might not get what I lack
But it doesn't hurt to askIf I want to sail
I need my life to be breezier
I said "Please God or someone
Make it easier"I went to Sunday school every Sunday
Swallowed the bait and I got the hook
When I needed something someday
I would read the real good bookAnd tell me, what does it take to get ahead?
Times I know I'd sell my soul
It looks like everybody else is flying
And I'm crawling in the holeWell, maybe if I open my own business
Maybe if I buy the lottery ticket
Someone tell me what is the secret
We're gettin' out of the thicketGive me more than just a sample
I need a whole lot of, lot of glory
My life become an example
Of the American success storyI want to slide into the black
And wear the black mask
I might not get what I lack
But it doesn't hurt to askIf I want to sail
I need my life to be breezier
I said "Please God or someone
Make it easier"I want to slide into the black
And wear the black mask
I might not get what I lack
But it doesn't hurt to askIf I want to sail
I need my life to be breezier
I said "Please God or someone
Make it easier
Make it easier
Make it easier" 
Well, there's something in us living
There's something you should know
There was a time for us to fall
Now it's time to grow
But you know it's not the way
That I intended it to be
Crossing hearts and killing souls
And trying to get down to what's real
All I ever wanted was to make this house a home
I let go of sinking sand - won't you help me find a stone?
All I ever wanted
All I ever wanted
All I ever wanted
All I ever wanted
All I ever wanted
Was to make this house a home
All I needed was your hand to hold
I spent so much time alone
I needed your direction
But we re-aligned my broken bones
Well, they're running from a lifeless state
Somehow we lost our hold
All we have with us is change
Left over from what started out as gold
All I ever wanted was to make this house a home
I let go of sinking sand - won't you help me find a stone?
All I ever wanted
All I ever wanted
All I ever wanted
All I ever wanted
All I ever wanted
Was to make this house a home
This is what I give to you
It's flesh and blood
It's body and soul
Won't you take what's left of who I am
And try to see it whole?
I'm holding you responsible for every word I say
If you feel the brokenness
Won't you try and look the other way
I never meant to be so low
I only wanted you to see
That time was healing someone else
But it's tearing apart the very heart of me
This is what I give to you
It's flesh and blood
It's body and soul
Won't you take what's left of who I am
And try to see it whole?
All I ever wanted was to make this house a home
I let go of sinking sand - won't you help me find a stone?
All I ever wanted
All I ever wanted
All I ever wanted
All I ever wanted
All I ever wanted
Was to make this house a home
So make this house a home
make this house a home
make this house a home 
What am I gonna do with you?
So far away, it makes me blue
I never mind just being alone
but I felt defeated and I let it show
You know I could have ridden the rainbow
And this once I needed you to let me knowCHORUS:
I couldn't keep myself from making promises
I'm of two hearts and up all night
I couldn't keep myself from making promises
I'm gonna get it right this timeWho's gonna say you paid your dues
With the strung out soundman
and the promoter dude?
With a pat on the back just a little far down
You cut your teeth on a drinking crowd
Ah never mind you didn't make it
What's the point if you're never gonna shake it?CHORUS:And when the spring is coming around
And I'm feeling braver I'm gonna lay it down
And when the teenage hoodlums come out
I'm gonna give 'em a smile
And just a little doubt
Ah never mind you didn't make it
What's the point if you're never gonna shake it?CHORUS: 
Eddie said the beat was wrong
Tom didn't like the tune
The boy with a beard in the corner
Laughed in the middle of a song
He didn't stay very longEddie said the lights were low
Tom said the treble was high
The boy with a beard in the corner
Laughed in the middle of a sigh
Don't think we ever even caught his eyeSometimes I used to find
I'd be singing to you
As if you were sitting
At the table by the doorEddie said a friend of his
Is making it big in l.a.
Ah well everybody down at malachy's
Says I'm gonna make it somedaySometimes I used to write
A song for you
As if you were sitting
At the table by the doorSometimes I used to find
I'd be singing to you
As if you were sitting
At the table by the door

Building for keeps
The art of the theater
And joinery??Something of wood and iron
Steady and strong
Joining of hearts is a trick far beyond meCupids of heaven
Are painted to my hand
Cuz baby won't go (baby won't go)
Go for that showI read your name in charcoal
A century ago
I stood in the rafters
The world moved belowAll for the reverie
Of rigging and rope
Untangle the tempest of love
Is another man's callingThe cupids of heaven
Are painted to my hand
Cuz baby won't go (baby won't go)
Go for that showOh to be free
From the swell of the moon
To stand in one place
While she moves to youThe cupids of heaven
Are painted to my hand
Cuz baby won't go (baby won't go)
Go for that show 
The boy he thinks I'm damaged goods
I know he does and I guess he should
I dress like him and I take him down
He gets embarrassed when his friends come aroundI can get the girl
But the boys just laugh
I can get the girls
But the boys just laughSo this is a measure of me
Even though it shouldn't be
The lion lays down with the lamb
But I can't do it so I ain't worth a damnI can get the girls
But the boys just laugh
I can get the girls
But the boys just laugh at meCome on now graceful
I want you to be
Come on now social
I said I want you to be
Come on now special
I I want you to be
I want you to beI the virgin in the woods
Tell me now if they are goodIs it the boys who needed me
I am you and you set it freeI get the girls
But the boys just laugh
I get the girl
But the boys he laughs at meI said this is the measure of me
And even though it shouldn't be
The lion lays down with the lamb
Yeah but I can't do it and I ain't worth a damn 
Crossroads seem to come and go
The gypsy flies from coast to coast
Knowing many, loving none
Bearing sorrow, having fun
But back home he'll always run
To sweet Melissa.
Freight train, each car looks the same - all the same
No one knows the gypsy's name
No one hears his lonely sighs
There are no blankets where he lies
In all his deepest dreams the gypsy flies
With sweet Melissa.
Again the morning's come
Again he's on the run
Sunbeams shining through his hair
Appearing not to have a care
Pick up your gear, and, gypsy, roll on, roll on
Crossroads, will you ever let him go?
Will you hide the dead man's ghost?
Will he lie beneath the clay?
Will his spirit float away?
But I know that he won't stay
Without Melissa
Yes, I know that he won't stay
Without Melissa

Well I guess that I was lonely
That's why I called you on the phone
'Cause in a moment of forgiveness
I didn't wanna be aloneAnd I guess that I was willin'
More than I ever was before
'Cause in a moment of forgiveness
I come a knockin' at your doorBaby I woke up crying last night
Just to realize that you were gone
Has it been two long years without you
Tell me now
When are you gonna come homeGuess that I was hoping
That you'd finally understand
And in a moment of forgiveness
You'd reach out and take my handNow baby I know (baby I know)
You're not one for bearing witness
And you told me that (one wrong move)
One wrong move is gonna sell you out
And I see that you kept your word (see that you kept your word)
And made it harder than it had to be
Wish I could save you the trouble baby (oh oh oh)
Give you a little piece of mindBaby I woke up crying last night
Just to realize that you were gone
It's been two long years without you
When are you gonna come homeGuess that I was hoping
That you'd finally understand
And in a moment of forgiveness
You'd reach out and take my handAnd in a moment of forgiveness
You'd reach out and take my hand 
Now I know
Spanish Harlem are not just pretty words to say
I thought I knew but now I know
That rose trees never grow in New York City'Til you've seen this trash, can dream come true
Stand at the edge, have people run you through
I thank the Lord, there's people out there like you
Thank the Lord, there's people out there like youWhile Mona Lisas and Mad Hatters
Sons of bankers, sons of lawyers
Turn around and say good morning to the nightFor unless they see the sky
But they can't and that is why
They know not if it's dark outside or lightThis broadway's got, it's got a lot of songs to sing
If I knew the tunes, I might join in
I'll go my way alone, grow my own
My own seed shall be sown in New York CitySubway's no way for this good man to go down
Rich man can ride and the hobo, he can drown
I thank the Lord for the people I have found
I thank the Lord for the people I have foundWhile Mona Lisas and Mad Hatters

But they can't and that is why
They know not if it's dark outside or light

So money made you mean
That's not how it's supposed to be
You're ready to challenge or defend
Yeah, for all the wrong reasonsHow much do we really need?
A question if you have to ask
Just means what it means
The question that says everythingRight or left, it's all the same conspiracy
Just 'cause you ask doesn't make a difference to meYou could keep it all or give it away
But where does it come from in the first place?
Robbing Peter to pay me and I'll just be
Giving it back to Peter to feel freeAnd you have to fix everything that's broke
'Cause it'll never leave you alone
Reinvent the wheel, be the butt of a joke

As I drive from your pearly gates
I realize that I just can't stay
All those mountains, they kept you locked inside
And hid the truth from my slighted eyesI came to you with a half-open heart
Dreams upon my back
Illusions of the brand new start
NashvilleCan't I carry the load?
Is it my fault that
I can't reap what I sow?
NashvilleDid you give me half a chance
With your Southern style?
And your hidden dance away
You dance away, you dance awayAll these voices, they whisper through my walls
They talk of falling fast, they say I'm losing it all
They say I'm running blind to love of my own
But I'll be walking proud, I'm saving what I still ownI fell on my knees to kiss your land
But you are so far down
And I can't even see to stand
In NashvilleYou forgot the human race
You see with half a mind
What colors hide the face
NashvilleI'd like to know your fate, I'd like to stay a while
But I've seen your lowered states today
I've seen 'em today
Honey, I swear I've seen 'em todayNow I'm leaving, I've got all these debts to pay
You know we all have our dues, I'll pay 'em some other place
Ah I never ask that you pay me back
We all arrive with more, I left with less than I hadYour town is made for people passin' through
A last chance for a cause
I thought I knew
But NashvilleYou tell me what you are gonna do
With all your Southern style
It'll never pull you through
NashvilleI can't place no blame
But if you forget my face
I'll never call your name again
No never again, no never againI fell on my knees to kiss your land
But you are so far down
And I can't even see to stand
In NashvilleYou forgot the human race
You see with half a mind
What colors hide the face
NashvilleI'd like to know your fate, I'd like to stay a while
But I've seen your lowered states today
I've seen 'em today
Honey, I swear I've seen 'em todayI'm running away
I'm running away
I'm running, I'm running
I'm running away 
You say, "She's a very good friend"
Circumstances I should understand
But like recurring tide she comes on to you
And looks as though she's looking for a manHoney, don't make yourself so available
My pride's in my pocket but I can be reasonable
Still all in all I foresee my own fall
But I've climbed too far to drop, so stopI know it's your ego keep the smile on your face
Because you know you got your options open
She's a beguiling snake and she'll keep what she takes
But she leaves you, I'll be the one copingHoney, don't make yourself so available
My pride's in my pocket but I can be reasonable
Still through and through I can see clean through you
I know you like to be the one on top, but stopYou will miss my conversation
When you're talking to yourself
You'll be thumbing for advice
Through the pages of the novels on your shelfHoney, don't you see our love together is the very best bet
Put your focus on me I'll forgive and forget
Throw away your hidden ace
You clever man, take my handWell, you needn't play the part of your image
This is not a one act play we're living
And as long as I'm here the situation is clear
It'll be fifty-fifty take and givingHoney, don't you see a lifetime's not much to ask
Take off your costume and remove your mask
"Yes" is what you will say we're gonna start from today
Gonna take it to the very top, never stop 
As I was wading through your distance
I heard you say "there's no way out"
And I was just thinking as my independence faded
Well there's no way in for meThere's no way out and you know
There's no way in
We're on either side
Scared to say we're friendsNow I found jesus and you found yourself
Sometimes I still feel like I'm losing out
But we both found that it's just too hard to know for sure
Just what we can lean on when we're falling downYou always did see
The other side of things and sometimes
I'm bound to wonder
Do you see through meWith all the voids I tried to fill
And all the emptiness I tried to tell you about
There was never time enough
There are never words enough
And I'll never have the guts enough
But I'll tell you I've been needing you so badThere's no way out and you know
There's no way in for me now
And we're on either side
And we're crying for a friendThere's no way out and you said
There's no way in for me now
And we're on either side
And we're scared to say we're friends 
When I walked you to the door, I was feeling mighty fine
I was thinking "Hey, I've got love to ease my mind."
Then I got to the car, and I was staring at your scars
Thinking "Hey, this ain't no way to spend my time."
I want a true love affair, not this touch-and-go in the air
You know I don't know if I'm coming or I'm down
I don't want a love touch and go, I want a feeling I only know
Or else you can't get me out of this town.
When I saw you smile, it was just one look into your eyes
And I was thinking "Hey, you're in love again."
Then I heard you laugh, honey, you were laughing at the past
I was thinking "This ain't no way to treat a friend."
You were laughing at the past, you were smiling through your glass
Watching cars drive away in your mind
You were hoping I would leave, honey, I was dreaming I could stay
This ain't no way to spend my time.
(At this point, recent versions have a guitar solo, while early
versions include a bridge with the following lyrics:
This ain't no way to treat a friend
This ain't no way to see me
I'm looking for the end
This ain't no way to treat a friend.)
I want words, I want touch, maybe that's a bit too much
For someone so far removed from what we used to claim
If you be cruel, I'll still be kind, I've got it in my mind
I'm in love with you, I ain't gonna play your game.
If you want my advice, don't say it's wrong if it feels right
Don't push me down just to see me crawl
I'll be crawling on your floor, I'll be reaching for the door
I'll be crawling right out of your eyes
Honey, I'll be walking right out of your eyes
Baby, I'll be walking right out of your eyes 
We had our day, and now it's over
We had our song, and now it's all sung
We took our stroll through summer's clover
But summer's gone, baby, and the walking's done.
So, tell me gently, who'll be your lover?
Who'll be your lover after I am gone?
Will it be the moon that hears your sighing?
Will it be the willow that hears your lonesome sigh?
Will it be the rain that clings to your bosom?
Will it be the sunshine that dries your golden hair?
Will it be the wind that warns of my returning?
Will the rose be in your arms when I find you waiting there?
None but the rain shall cling to my bosom
None but the moon shall hear my lonesome sighs
None but the wind shall warn of my returning
So fare thee well, my love, goodbye 
We blew off immigration, the moon was sittin' high
We drove from Lacandona into Comitan
Gloria was singin' and Cecilia closed her eyes
And I saw them drifting out over the night skyI said Nuevas Senoritas
"Are you gone to brighter days?
Have you found your greener valley
And the place where your heart stays?"Headed back to the flatlands and you headed up to the hills
Rain brings you home middle of July
I guess I just got lonesome, think about how you feel
Six months gone no one to dry your eyesI said Nuevas Senoritas
"Are you gone to brighter days?
Have you found your greener valley
And the place where your heart stays?" 
Oh holy night, the stars are brightly shining
It is the night of our dear Savior's birth
Long lay the world in sin and error pining
Till He appeared and the soul felt its worth
A thrill of hope the weary world rejoices
For yonder breaks a new and glorious mornFall on your knees
Oh, hear the angel voices
Oh, night divine
Oh, night when Christ was born
Oh night, oh holy night
Oh, night divineTruly He taught us to love one another
His law is love and His gospel is peace
Chains shall He break for the slave is our brother
And in His name all oppression shall cease
Sweet hymns of joy in grateful chorus raise we
Let all within us praise His holy nameFall on your knees
Oh, hear the angel voices
Oh, night divine
Oh, night when Christ was bornFall on your knees
Oh, hear the angel voices
Oh, night divine
Oh, night when Christ was born
Oh night, oh holy night
Oh, night divineOh night, oh holy night
Oh, night divine 
 
Now we can say that nothings lost
And only change brings 'round the prophecy
Well now it's melting the solid frost
Was once a veil on greener landscapes we would seeBeneath my surface the water's heating
The steam comes up and out the tears you see me shine
For every strange and bitter moment
There was never a better timeFor every pleasure exacts its pain
How you hurt me, how you were good to me
Beneath my window a mournful train
That makes me smile at my bad poetryBut beneath my surface a song is rising
And it may be simple well it hides it's true intent
We may be a looking for our deliverance
But it has already been sentIt's in the nightfall when the light falls
And what you've seen isn't there anymore
It's in our blind trust, love will find us
Just like it has beforeThey're sending soldiers to distant places
X's and O's on someones drawing board
Like green and plastic but with human faces
And they want to tell you it's a merciful swordBut with all the blood newly dried in the desert
Can we not fertilize the land with something else
There is no nation by God exempted
Lay down your weapons and love your neighbor as yourselfIt's in the nightfall when the light falls
And what you've seen isn't there anymore
It's through our blind trust that love will find us
Just like it has before 
Words and music by Emily SaliersNow we can say
That nothings lost
And only change
Brings round the prophecy
Well now it's melting
The solid frost
Was once a veil on greener landscapes
We would see
Beneath my surface
The waters heating
The steam comes up and out the tears
You see me shine
For every strange and bitter moment
There was never a better timeFor every pleasure
Exacts its pain
How you hurt me
How you were good to me
Beneath my window
A mournful train
That makes me smile
At my bad poetry
But beneath my surface
A song is rising
And it may be simple
Well it hides its true intent
We may be looking for our deliverence
But it has already been sentIt's in the nightfall
When the light falls
And what you've seen
Isn't there anymore
It's in our blind trust
Love will find us
Just like it has beforeThey're sending soldiers
To distant places
X's and O's
On someones drawing board
Like green and plastic
But with human faces
And they want to tell you
It's a merciful sword
But with all the blood
Newly dried in the desert
Can we not fertilize the land with something else
There is no nation
By god exempted
Lay down your weapons
And love your neighbor as yourselfIt's in the nightfall
When the light falls
And what you've seen
Isn't there anymore
It's through our blind trust
Love will find us 
{He did, he observed Saturday as the sabbath
What, what kind of faith does that make him?
Uhh, he didn't have one
Oh, okay
He didn't believe in any one thing
He would go out on the street and all the kids would play the
With a drum like thing, some, some kind of an instrument, yeah
And Mama played the organ, she had a organ and she played that
And she got a real big kick out of it, but didn't have the patience
[Incomprehensible]}Oh oh Ozilline
The moon is almost full
And you don't need a torchlight
To see into these woods
Now sister bring the medicine
To keep you from decline
But it's the waxing and the waining
That's always on your mindI said, "Oh Ozilline
I feel for you"
I said, "Oh Ozilline
I feel for you"As soon as the corn's in
The deer will come to feed
And when the berry ripens
The bird will come to eat
You build by the river
It's pretty but you'll pay
'Cause the springtime brings the flood plain
And your cutback washes awayI said, "Oh Ozilline
I feel for you"
I said, "Oh Ozilline
I feel for you"And I had to put the dog down
Before I hit the road
Yeah, I watched that sweet old life
Become a bag of bones
So when your body's broken
And your heart wants to give in
You hear that hoot owl callin'
Just like she was a friendI said, "Oh Ozilline
I feel for you"
I said, "Oh Ozilline
I feel for you"I said, "Ozilline, she don't let you cry"
If you ask her where it hurts
I said, "Ozilline, she don't let you cry"
If you ask her where it hurts
She said,"What a blessed sky" 
"Passin' Time" is an Amy Ray song from "Color Me Grey."
Passin' Time.
She was grasping for a way to tell us all
The hurt she felt inside
"We're all too happy," she says, "Let's have a war,"
And the knife digs deeper in.
It's just some words to pass the time
Some words to pass the time.
Now when the silence gets to be too much
I can feel the souls searching
Where do I go when I've lost my cause?
We all have stories
Even the good ones let me down
They're all just words to pass the time.
I used to be so sincere, and maybe I still am
But all this small talk I've been reeling off
Is slowly getting out of hand.
I mix real feelings with the ones I wish I had
And I catch the most important one in between them all
Sometimes it seems like they're all just words to pass the time.
And then we've lost our time
And we've wasted our words
And all restraint is gone
Sometimes it's too unreal to believe
Just don't give it all away - get a grip
Sometimes they're all just words to pass the time.
I said I'm too high, I'm too high
And I'm scared of falling down
I've just been grasping for words to make you want to stay
To make it all worthwhile
'Cause I don't want to spend the rest of my life
Just passing time
No, I don't want to spend the rest of my life here
Just passing time. 
Peace Child,
in the sleep of the night,
in the dark before light
you come,
in the silence of stars,
in the violence of wars--
Savior, your name.Peace Child,
to the road and the storm,
to the gun and the bomb
you come,
through the hate and the hurt,
through the hunger and dirt--
bearing a dream.Peace Child,
to our dark and our sleep,
to the conflict we reap,
now come--
be your dream born alive,
held in hope, wrapped in love:
God's true shalom. 
Now, everybody's looking for a little peace of mind
We're a generation running out of time
There's a bomb, there's a man, there's a gun in his hand, yeah
Well, nobody smiles at strangers, we're scared from birth
Afraid the man's gonna take us for all that we're worth
Strip us of our pride - make a strike from inside
(Come on and tell me)
How long will we be victims of fear
With a man and a gun and the "day after" fear
Jesus, smile down upon your children
Smile down upon your family
Now, even lovers have trouble at hand
What's your preference - where do you stand?
You get uptight about it, gonna fight about it
Gonna fight about love - that makes no sense to me
Wanting independence, separate but equal
Some are here, and others there
One more for the sequel to the heartache
How much more can we take?
(Won't you tell me)
How long will we be victims of fear
With a man and a gun and the "day after" fear
Jesus, smile down upon your children
Smile down upon your family 
Honey pick the red corner shoes
The ones that hardly ever get used
I knelt in front of my whole collection
And I'm picking you a special selection
On a no news is good news middle of mid-year day
I feel no ill with time to kill I wanna playLet's make peace tonight (let's make peace tonight)
The moon is bare and shining bright (moon is shining bright)
Let's make peace tonight in a good time (let's make peace tonight)I'm callin' on my good friends today
You know the drive's about an hour away
Then we'll be pitching up a tent by the trees
And we'll be wading in the river to our knees
Oh woah love's been planted and we're checking out the yield
It's two black dogs and a white one their running in the fieldSo let's make peace tonight (let's make peace tonight)
The moon is bare and shining bright (moon is shining bright)
Well let's make peace tonight in a good time (let's make peace tonight)Well we used to have some money but we spent it (used to have some money but we spent it)
Yeah so when we want to have it then we rent it (when we want to have it we rent it)
But we're cuttin' up the rug and I know you love me love me (we're cuttin' up the rug and I know you love me)
And the best of everything here is free (everything here is free)
Oh when things get messy then we tidy up the room
We'll be no stranger to that dustpan and the broomLet's make peace tonight (let's make peace tonight)
The moon is bare and shining bright (moon is shining bright)
Let's make peace tonight (let's make peace tonight)
The moon is bare and shining bright (moon is shining bright)
Let's make peace tonight in a good time (let's make peace tonight in a good time) 
I meet you for coffee
We get together periodically
And I got a bad case, I can't shake off me
The fevered wondering
Now I'm wondering how it ought to beYou work in the system
You see possibilities and you're glistening
Eyes show the hell, you're gonna give 'em
When they back off the mic for once
And give it to a womanI dream like a mad one
Brutal fantasies I catch as catch can
I'm a psychic and a laywoman
I see love and I like to make it happenWhat we get from your war walk
The ticker of the nation breaking down like a bad clock
I want the pendulum to swing again
So that all your mighty mandate
Was just spitting in the windIt doesn't come by the bullwhip
It's not persuaded with your hands on your hips in it
It's not the company of gunslingers
The epicenter love is the pendulum swinger
She is, she isIt's fine about the old scroll Sanskrit
Gnostic gospels the Da Vinci Code, a smash hit
Aren't we dying just to read it and relate?
It's too hard just to go by a blind faithBut they left out the sisters
I've been praying to a father God
So long I really missed herThe goddess of benevolence
And you should listen to your mama
If you have a lick of sense leftIt doesn't come by the bullwhip
It's not persuaded with your hands on your hips in it
It's not the company of gunslingers
The epicenter love is the pendulum swinger
She is, she is, she is, she isPushed under by the main press
Buried under a code of dress
Relegated by the Vatican
But you can't keep a spirit down
That wants to get up againIf we're a drop in the bucket
With just enough science to keep from saying fuck it
Until the last drop of sun burns its sweet light
Plenty revolutions left until we get this thing rightDoesn't come by the bullwhip
It's not persuaded with your hands on your hips in it
It's not the company of gunslingers
The epicenter love is the pendulum swinger
She is, she is, she is, she is 
We get to be, a ripple in the water
We get to be a rock that's thrown
We get to be a boy on the bridge
Standing over the reservoir
See the water lap along the shore line
The buried forest of a man made lake
Cemeteries are laying underneath it
Your heart like a dam when it breaksWe are floating, we are swimming
And in this moment we are forgetting
What it costs, what it takes
For one perfect world
When we look the other wayI'm okay, if I don't look a little closer
I'm OK if I don't see beyond the shore
I'm OK if I don't have to do the killing
Or know what the killing is forWe are talking, we are driving
And in this moment we are denying
What it costs, what it takes
For one perfect world
When we look the other way
It's one perfect world
When we look the other way
It's one perfect world
When we look the other way
It's one perfect worldIf you can't see beyond the myth of isolation
And the miracle of daybreak doesn't move you anymore
Connect the points and see the constellations
As the night comes down on the reservoirWe are swimming, we are floating
And in this moment we are beholden to
What it costs, to what it takes
For one perfect world
Can we learn to live another way?
It's one perfect world
Can we learn to live another way?
It's one perfect world
Can we learn to live another way?
It's one perfect worldWe get to be a ripple in the water 
Welcome to why the church has died
And the heart of the exile and the kingdom of hate
Who owns the land and keeps the commands
And marries itself to the stateModern scribes write in jesus christ
Everyone is free
And the doors open wide to all straight men and women
But they are not open to meWho is teaching kids to be soldiers
To be marked by a plain white cross
And we kill just a little to save a lot more
The philosophy of lossNow there are a few who would be true
Out of love and love is hard
And don't think that our hands haven't shoveled the dirt
Over their central american graveyardsDoctors and witch hunters stripped you bare
Left you nothing for your earthly sins
Yeah but who made this noise just a bunch of boys
And the one with the most toys winsAnd who is teaching kids to be gamblers
Life is a coin toss
And of course what you give up is what you gain
The philosophy of lossWhatever has happened to anyone else
Could happen to you and to me
And the end of my youth was the possible truth
That it all happens randomlySo who is teaching kids to be leaders
And the way that it is is meant to be
The philosophy of loss 
Well, we read best selling novels so we can talk between the lines
And we often close our eyes just to hide the dollar signs
And we're suddenly pretentious, and conform right with the stream
We're born and bred believers in the American Dream.
And we drink our whiskey straight, though we do not like the taste
And we dress in obligations, with a top hat show of haste
And we hinder our reactions as we measure what we say
Until someone starts to cry and the faces turn away, again.
Play it again, Sam, take it slow and easy
Sing about the land of the brave and the home of the free
And there's a man who will tip you better than you've gotten yet
If you play us a happy song and help us forget
Play it again, Sam.
Well, we'll donate to our charities to deduct our future taxes
And we flock to bars for drinking, though one never quite relaxes
And we'll compromise our standards if it means we'll get attention
And the things we need the most to say are the things we never
mention.
Play it again, Sam, take it slow and easy
Sing about the land of the brave and the home of the free
And there's a man who will tip you better than you've gotten yet
If you play us a happy song and help us forget
Play it again, Sam.
Now I know God is in His Heaven, though it's hard to keep in mind
When you're searching for relief, and hell is all you find
And I know that I'm a romantic, and I must seem a fool to say
But I know I'm going to see a few hands joined before my dying day.
Play it again, Sam, take it slow and easy
Sing about the land of the brave and the home of the free
And there's a man who will tip you better than you've gotten yet
If you play us a happy song and help us all forget
Play it again, Sam...
Play it again, Sam...
Play it again, Sam. 
Well, evening fell just like a star
Left a trail across the sky
You spit as you walked out the door
If this is love we're crazy
As we fight like cats and dogs
I just know there's got to be more
So please call me, baby
Wherever you are
It's too cold to be out walking the streets
We do crazy things when we're wounded
Everyone's a bit insane
I don't want you catching your death of cold
Walking in the rain
I'll admit I ain't no angel
I admit I ain't no saint
I'm selfish and cold but you're blind
If I exercise my devils
Well, my angels may leave too
And they're so hard to find
So please call me, baby
Wherever you are
It's too cold to be out walking the streets
We do crazy things when we're wounded
Everyone's a bit insane
I don't want you catching your death of cold
Walking in the rain
We're always at each other's throats
You know it drives me up the wall
Most of the time blowin' off steam
I wish to hell you'd leave me
I wish to God you'd stay
Life's so different in a dream
So please call me, baby
Wherever you are
It's too cold to be out walking the streets
We do crazy things when we're wounded
Everyone's a bit insane
I don't want you catching your death of cold
Walking in the rain
I don't want you catching your death of cold
Out walking in the rain 
I saw a vision
Little boy
You covered up your own insights
But I may have held your hand
Or seen the ghost you tried to fightOh a vision
Little boy
You strayed down to find the clowns
Oh and when I wrote these lines for you
Not, not one of them was foundBlame the circus and the clowns
Before you blame yourself
Cause when your greatest needs go unforgiven
And your gifts go unreceivedLittle boy
Man of need
Who could know that the road would fall
Not me not one of us
That surrounds your golden wallsSo now blame the circus and the clowns
Before you blame yourself
Cause all your greatest needs go unforgiven
All your gifts go unreceivedWho could know of the fall
Who could slow the speed
Who could hold your hand
We all laughed and thought you were so freeVision boy
Man of need
Oh do the monkeys get you down
Oh they promise you the dance of life
Complete with laughters crownLittle boy
Man of need
Did you find the freak show and a crowd
I said cut the canvas on the tent
Oh we were all innocentBlame the circus and the clowns
Before you blame yourself
When your greatest needs go unforgiven
And your gifts go unreceived
Oh your greatest needs go unforgiven
And your gifts they go unreceivedLittle boy
Man of need 
My place is of the sun and this place is of the dark
I do not feel the romance, I do not catch the spark
My place is of the sun and this place is of the dark
I do not feel the romance, I do not catch the sparkI don't know when I noticed life was life at my expense
The words of my heart lined up like prisoners on a fence
The dreams came in like needy children tugging at my sleeve
I said I have no way of feeding you, so leaveBut there was a time I asked my father for a dollar
And he gave it a ten dollar raise
And when I needed my mother and I called her
She stayed with me for daysSomeone's on the telephone, desperate in his pain
Someone's on the bathroom floor doing her cocaine
Someone's got his finger on the button in some room
No one can convince me, we're not gluttons for our doomBut I tried to make this place my place
I asked for providence to smile upon me
With his sweet face, yeah, but I'll tell youMy place is of the sun and this place is of the dark
I do not feel the romance, I do not catch the spark
My place is of the sun and this place is of the dark
I do not feel the romance, I will not be a pawn
For the prince of darkness any longerMaybe there's no haven in this world for tender age
My heart beat like the wings of wild birds in a cage
My greatest hope, my greatest cause to grieve
And my heart flew from its cage and it bled upon my sleeveThe cries of passion were like wounds that needed healing
I couldn't hear them for the thunder
I was half the naked distance between hell and heaven's ceiling
And it almost pulled me underSomeone's on the telephone, desperate in his pain
Someone's on the bathroom floor doing her cocaine
Someone's got his finger on the button in some room
No one can convince me, we're not gluttons for our doomWe should keep on trying to make this place our place
And ask for providence to smile upon the whole world
With his sweet face, we'll sing it togetherMy place is of the sun and this place is of the dark
I do not feel the romance, I do not catch the spark
My place is of the sun and this place is of the dark
I do not feel the romance, I do not catch the sparkMy place is of the sun and this place is of the dark
I do not feel the romance, I do not catch the spark
My place is of the sun, this place is of the dark
I do not feel the romance, I will not be a pawn
For the prince of darkness any longer 
I am a problem child
I've been wild all my days
All my anger and my rage
My senses said it would lead me astray
I said go go goRaise your hands
Raise your hands high
Don't take a seat
Don't stand aside this time
Don't assume anything
But go go goFive generations running fast
These things will not pass
This debtor's blood runs in my veins
I can't change anything
I said no no noRaise your hands
Raise your hands high
Don't take a seat
Don't stand aside this time
Don't assume anything
But go go goSo you've learned to cry
But you don't know why
So you've learned to laugh
What are we laughing atSo I am a problem child
I've been wild all my days
All my anger and my rage
My senses said it would lead me astray
And I said go go go
Go goRaise your hands
Raise your hands high
Don't take a seat
Don't stand aside this time
Don't assume anything this time
Don't assume anything
I said go go go 
Well I woke up this mornin'
Gray dawn
With a prayer on my breath
See I lost somethin' precious
And God'll save me
From losin' myselfI said I think I know what's wrong
I think I know what's wrongNow I met the Queen and I understand why
Why she closed the door
I'm not makin' excuses
But you know I've been there a few times
You know I was
I was knockin' on the doorI said I think I know what's wrong
I think I know what's wrong, wrong, wrongSee there's a man
He lived in a house
Had a family of five
Well he blew up the windows and the doors
He said I just couldn't
I just couldn't surviveWe've all been removed
In one way or another
Don't know our families
Pushin' the needle too far
Pushin' the needle too farWell if you wake up in the morning
Gray dawn
There's a prayer on your breath
See maybe you lost something precious
God'll save you
From losing yourselfI said I think I know what's wrong
Let me hear you
I think I know what's wrongThere's a Queen who closed the door
The family that lies
People who turn
The cat that has died
A boy that O.D's
A girl with a gun
The world on its knees
And a band on the run
You know you'd help me more
(The queen who closed the door)
By not giving in
(The family that lies)
You know you'd help me more
(People who turn)
By not givin' in
(And the cat that has died)
You'd help me more
(A boy that od's)
By not givin' in
(And a girl with a gun)
I said you'd help me more
(The world on it's knees)
Now don't you give in
(And a band on the run)
Ah now you'd help me more
By not givin'
I said don't you dare
(Not givin' in no)
Don't you dare
(Not givin' in no)
Don't you dare
You'd help me more
By not givin' in
I said you'd help me more
By not givin' in
I said I
I think I know what's wrong
I think I know what's wrong
We're pushin' the needle too far 
Ramblin' around your city
Ramblin' around your town
I never see a friend I know
As I go ramblin' 'round boys
As I go ramblin' 'roundMy mother hoped that I might be
A man of some renown
But I am just a refugee
As I go ramblin' 'round boys
As I go ramblin' 'roundThe peach trees they are loaded
The branches bending down
I pick 'em all day for a dollar boys
As I go 'ramblin 'round
As I go 'ramblin' 'roundSometimes the fruit gets rotten
And falls on to the ground
There's a hungry mouth for every peach
As I go ramblin' 'round boys
As I go ramblin' 'round 
Old pirates yes they rob i
Sold I to the merchant ships
Minutes after they took i
From the bottomless pit
But my hand was made strong
By the hand of the almighty
We forward in this generation
Triumphantly
Won't you help to sing
These songs of freedom
Cause all I ever had
Redemption songsEmancipate yourselves from mental slavery
None but ourselves can free our minds
Have no fear for atomic energy
Cause none of them are gonna stop the time
How long must they kill our prophets
While we stand aside and look
Some say it's just a part of it
We've got to fulfill the bookWon't you help to sing
These songs of freedom
Cause all I ever had
Redemption songs
Redemption songs
Redemption songs 
I had guards like watchdogs
Dogs in a manger
I could feel the protection
Possession and anger
And I drove out of there
With no one behind me
Feelin' funny and freeAll you pretty pretenders
Negligent vendors
Aren't you precious inside?
I have no need for anger
With intimate strangers and
I got nothin' to hide
(Yea)I laughed as I said it
This is my situation
It's not pictures or privilege
It's just self preservation
I don't want you to feel
(I don't want you to feel)
Any obligation
It feels so funny to be freeAll you pretty pretenders
Negligent vendors
Aren't you precious inside?
I have no need for anger
With intimate strangers and
I got nothin' to hideWe act empty and innocent
(I remember you)
But we are fueled by distortions
Of lives led in discontent
(When we were shiny and new now)
Trading misfortunes
(For your faith)
'Cause faith is one thing
That is hard to deliver
(Temper your speed)
It feels so funny to be freeAll you pretty pretenders
(La la)
Negligent vendors
(La la)
(Aren't you precious inside?)
Aren't you precious inside?
(La la la)
I have no need
(I have now no need for anger)
(La la)
Intimate strangers
(La la)
I got nothin' to hide
I got nothin' to hideOoh ooh
(La la la la la)
La la la la la la
(Ooh)
La la la la la la
(La la la la la)
La la la la la la
(La la la la la)
La la love la love la
(La la la love la love)
La la la la laAll of us, all of us
(All)
(Aren't we?)
All of us, all of us
(Of us)
Pretty pretenders
Negligent vendors
Aren't we precious inside?
I have no need for anger
With intimate strangers and
I got nothin' to hide
I got nothin' to hideI had guards like watchdogs
(I remember)
Dogs in a manger
(You) 
Dog at the window still, looks all day never gets her fill
'Cause a glance means a chance to break the birds out congregating
I have seen a look like that, you licked your chops from where you sat
Make your kill for a thrill and you don't mind waiting
Rise up your dead, there's life in the old girl yet
Rise up your deadWhen it bums you out, all the hunters sprung to pounce
And at best it's a mess like a nest infested
You remember there's more than this
There always was and always isTend the artist in your charges, you are full invested
Rise up your dead, there's life in the old girl yet
Rise up your deadAnd if you need to, read your mindless mag
Call me up for tickets, we'll go see Sugarland
And it gets better even when it's been a drag
Just move to the music, move your body to the band and
Rise upRise up your dead
Rise up your dead
Rise up your deadRise up your dead
Rise up your dead
Rise up your deadCome on, come on
Oh, the summers' coming
The rain's been heavy and the rivers runin'
Loose the calf, it's been tough
But it's fast and groovin'We got sticks to a hundred piles
We got stories that lead to smiles
We gotta twirl with this world
I can feel it movin'Rise up your dead
There's a life in the old girl yet
Rise up your deadRise up your dead
There's a life in the old girl yet
Rise up your dead 
It's comin' on Christmas
They're cuttin' down trees
Puttin' up reindeer
And singin' songs of joy and peace
I wish I had a river
I could skate away onBut it don't snow here
Stays pretty green
Gonna make a lot of money
Then I'm gonna quit this crazy scene
And I wish I had a river
I could skate away onI wish I had a river so wide
Teach my feet to fly
I wish I had a river
I could skate away on
'Cause I made my baby cryYou tried hard to help me I know
Put me at ease
Then loved me so naughty
Made me weak in my knees
And wish I had a river
That I could skate away onI was so hard to handle
I'm selfish and I'm sad
Now I lost the best baby
That I ever had
And I wish I had a river
That I could skate away onI wish I had a river so wide
Teach my feet to fly
Wish I had a river
That I could skate away on
'Cause I made my baby say goodbyeIt's comin' on Christmas
They're cuttin' down trees
Puttin' up reindeer
And singin' songs of joy and peace
But I wish I had a river
I could skate away onGod I wish I had a river so wide
Teach my feet to fly
Wish I had a river
I could skate away on
I made my baby say goodbye 
Didn't happen for you
No one wants to hear the truth
Coming from three political queers
Plucking the punk rock bloomSo you break up the band
And leave us all in tow
Yeah, now we gotta figure out where to goI caught it at a rave
(Did it give you vaccination?)
I saw it on my TV
(Did it lighten up your load?)
And every fuckin' DJ
(Did you feel affilliated?)
Is telling me I'm free
(Like you really had a home)Free to be a loser
(Were the ticket prices too high?)
Free to be a trend
(Were the lights too bright?)
Free to be a backlash over and over and over again
(Was it all a bunch of hype?)You say, I'm losing inspiration one band at a time
Because I gotta know there's someone
Somewhere out there singing for our sideI come up, we share the mortar and the glue
What we build together, we share that too
And the wind may come and the rain may fall
But we stand together or we don't stand at all and I sayWhere are you going to now?
Now that the going's gone
Where are you going to now?Here's to, here's to your survival
And swimming up the stream
Crossing over one dam after another
Until we get to rock and roll Heaven's gateI caught it at a rave
(Did it give you vaccination?)
I saw it on the TV
(Did it lighten up your load?)
And every fucking DJ
(Did you feel affiliated?)
Is telling me I'm free
(Like you really had a home)Free to be a loser
(Were the ticket prices too high?)
Free to be a trend
(Were the lights too bright?)
Free to be a backlash over and over
Until I get to rock and roll Heaven's gate 
Oh people
Look around you
The signs are everywhere
You've left it for somebody other than you
To be the one to care
You're lost inside your houses
And there's no time to find you now
Well your walls are turning
Your towers are burning
Gonna leave you here
And try to get down to the sea somehowThe road is filled with homeless souls
Every woman child and man
Who have no idea where they will go
But they'll help you if they can
But everyone must have some thought
That's gonna pull them through somehow
While the fires are raging hotter and hotter
The sisters of the sun are gonna
Rock me on the water nowRock me on the water
Sister will you soothe my fevered brow
Rock me on the water
I'll get down the sea somehowOh people
Look among you
It's there your hope must lie
There's a seabird above you
Gliding in one place
Like jesus in the sky
We all must do the best we can
And then hang on the that gospel plow
When my life is over
Gonna stand before the father
And the sisters of the sun are gonna
Rock me on the water nowRock me on the water
Sister will you soothe my fevered brow
Rock me on the water
Maybe I'll remember
Maybe I'll remember howRock me on the water
I said the wind is with me now
So rock me on the water
I'll get down the sea somehowRock me on the water
Sister will you soothe my fevered brow
Rock me on the water
I'll get down the sea somehow 
There's colors on the street
Red white and blue
People shuffling their feet
People sleeping in their shoes
There's a warning sign on the road ahead
There's a lot of people saying we'd be better off dead
Don't feel like saton but I am to them
So I try to forget it any way I can
Keep on rockin' in the free world
Keep on rockin' in the free world
Keep on rockin' in the free world
Keep on rockin' in the free worldI see a woman in the night
With a baby in her hands
Under an old street light
Next to a garbage can
And she puts the kid away
Cause she wants to get a hit
She hates her life
And what she's done to it
One more kid that will never go to school
Never get to fall in love never get to be cool
Keep on rockin' in the free world
Keep on rockin' in the free world
Keep on rockin' in the free world
Keep on rockin' in the free worldWe got a thousand points of light
For the homeless man
A kinder gentler machine gun hand
We got department stores and toliet paper
Styrofoam boxes for the ozone layer
The man in power says to keep our hope alive
Fuel to burn roads to drive
Keep on rockin' in the free world
Keep on rockin' in the free world
Keep on rockin' in the free world
Keep on rockin' in the free world 
Love struck Romeo
Sings the streets a serenade
He's layin' everybody low
He's got a love song that he made
Well he finds a convenient street light
And he steps out of the shade and says something like
"You and me babe how about it?"Juliet says, "Hey it's Romeo
You nearly gave me a heart attack yeah well"
He's underneath my window now she's singin'
"Hey la my boyfriend's back
You shouldn't come around here
Singin' up to people like that
Oh anyway, what you gonna do about it?"Oh Juliet the dice were loaded from the start
And I bet
And you exploded into my heart
And I forget, I forget the movie song
When you gonna realize?
It was just that the time was wrong
JulieWe both come up on different streets
And they were both streets of shame
They're both dirty both mean
And yes even our dreams were the same
But I dreamed your dream for you
And now your dream is real so tell me honey
Now how can you look at me as
If I were just another one of your deals?Now you can fall for chains of silver
And you can fall for chains of gold
You know you, you fall for pretty strangers
And the promises since they hold
Well you promised me everything
And then you, and then you promised me thick and thin
And now you just turn away and say
"Romeo I think I used to have a scene with him"Oh Juliet when we made love you used to cry
You said, "I love you like the stars above
I'm gonna love you till I die"
There's a place for us, I know you know this song
Now when you gonna realize it was just that the time was wrong?
Julie I'm so in love
So in love yeahBut I can't do the talk
Like they talk on my TV screen
I can't do a love song
Not the way you sung it to me
I can't do anything
But I would do anything for you, oh no
I can't do anything
Except be in love with youYeah now all I do is miss you
And the way it used to be
And all, and all I do is keep the beat
I keep bad, bad company
And all I do is kiss you
Through the bars of this rhyme
When Julie I'd do the stars with you
AnytimeOh Juliet when we made love you used to cry
You said, "I love you like the stars above
I'm gonna love you till I die"
There's a place for us, I know you know the movie song
One day you gonna realize it was just that the time was wrong
Julie, Julie, JulieOh this love struck Romeo
Sings the streets a serenade
Layin' everybody low
He's got a love song that he made
Finds a convenient street light
And he'll step out of the shade and he'll say something like
"You and me babe how about it?" 
You don't want me calling you up
All melancholy sick from love
You prefer it uncomplicated
Things are tricky now, I bet you hate it
Your mind's eye finds the exit sign
And you're off in perfect fashionAnd you run, that's all you've ever done
It's all you know to do
I can't hold that against you
And you'll flee 'cause you're born to be free
And if you go I'll understand
But you better get out while you canThe party's over, we had our fun
Flirting with madness a loaded gun
As much as nothing, everything's changed
I'm soaking in it, it falls like rain
You seek the sun to dry off what's been done
You'll heat up every corner of the worldAs you run, that's all you've ever done
It's all you know to do
I can't hold that against you
And you'll flee, 'cause you're born to be free
And if you go I'll understand
But you better get out while you canCan you keep this pace forever
I have never seen it done
You deep burn all you leave behind you
You're the surface of my sunI measure to what degree
I can shape up what's been forged in me
The copper penny hissing in the pool
So much for wishes, so much for cooling
Down this fire impossible desire
The further you get the more I'm drawnAnd you run, that's all you've ever done
That's all you know to do
I can't hold that against you
And you'll flee 'cause you're born to be free
And if you go I'll understandYeah, you run, that's all you've ever done
It's all you know to do
I can't hold that against you
And you'll flee 'cause you're born to be free
And if you go I'll understand
But you better get out while you can 
I took off last night with my coat and my intention
To make connections with the eyes that left me blind
Left my mouth for the strength of that white, white line.
I left one more time I could have heard "I love you"
One more time I could have heard "I care"
One more time when I needed that emotion
One more time I wasn't even there.
Through the darkness and the distance lie champagne and smoky smiles
Bounded by the sorrow, having lost love to the mile
I feel you - you're not a stranger to this white, white line.
I watched your ashes burn so slowly - illusions to my view
But I laugh and say it's Highway 75 that draws me here
It's not me, and it's not you.
I left one more time I should have said "I love you"
One more time I should have told you "I care"
When we sit here in silence
And we miss the ones we love that can't be here
It's a love we leave behind.
(solo)
I tried to lose this restless spirit in a mission of regrets
But I can't survive without this war
And your eyes reflect the vision that I can't forget.
I find balance on a darkened highway
I find truth by the side of the road
And someone else's tune to lift me high above the line
That leaves me running from the cold...
Running from the cold...
Running from the cold 
Mister, pull up a chair, I got time for tears
So tell me all the stories that you never did
Of the salty south, the Seminoles held out
While Geronimo died in a lonely jailThousand tides, thousand waves
Takin' it all away
It'll come back in, we'll be gone by then
And it's a miracle we ever learned to liveYou drain that land for a better plan
Sugarcane and the civil man
But now the ringin' dead them pines planted in that time
We gonna keep on killin' till they get it rightThousand tides, thousand waves
Takin' it all away
It'll come back in, we'll be gone by then, oh
And it's a miracle we ever learned to liveI remember the wind as it was settlin'
And every sun goin' down was a picture then
But we look back at 'em framed, they all look the same
There's no sense of time, no sense of painThousand tides, thousand waves
Takin' it all away
It'll come back in, we'll be gone by then, oh
And it's a miracle we ever learned to give 
As I was wading through your distance
I heard you say "There's no way out."
And I was just thinking as my independence faded
There's no way in for me.
There's no way out and you know
There's no way in
We're on either side
Scared to say we're friends.
Now, I found Jesus, and you found yourself
Sometimes I still feel like I'm losing out
But we both found that it's just too hard to know for sure
Just what we can lean on when we're falling down.
You always did see the other side of things
And sometimes
I'm bound to wonder
Do you see through me?
With all the voids I tried to fill
And all the emptiness I tried to tell you about
There was never time enough
There are never words enough
And I'll never have the guts enough
But I'll tell you I've been needing you so bad.
There's no way out and you know
There's no way in for me now
And we're on either side
And we're crying for a friend.
There's no way out and you said
There's no way in for me now
And we're on either side
And we're scared to say we're friends 
Scooter boys and Argentineans
Europe shed the blood of the Indians
Here I sit in the land of plenty
Crying about my own virginityHey blue blood you're nothing new
See I come from privilege too
A chapter in the book on the Americans
And your just another colonial terroristScooter boys and Argentineans
Europe shed the blood of the Indians
'N' here I sit in the land of plenty
Crying about my own virginityYeah
Yeah
Yeah
YeahWay down south where the Maya reign
Zapata reading poetry in his grave
They say we're stealing from the best
To feed the poor
Well they need moreScooter boys and Argentineans
Europe shed the blood of the Indians
Here I sit in the land of plenty
Crying about my own virginityYeah
Yeah
Oh
Yeah
Yeah 
Second time around you know it's really got me down
Sister, don't you judge it, keep it to yourself now
If you ain't got nothin' good to say, don't say nothin' at allGot bitten by the bitter bug and I just can't get enough
Ill will and my own concedin', weary of the world it seems
I'm weary of the world, weary of the world it seemsSort of always come my way I'm just a little bit off these days
Like the hard knocks saw in my life like I'm a Bible belt wife
Like I didn't see it comin', like I didn't walk intentionallySee I never wanna sing again, la, la, la, like a butterfly
Out my wits about me, out my heart in line
Third time's a charm, this is mineYou said you heard Loretta sing
And you felt the loneliness seepin' in
Cowboys made you uneasy you're a god-fearin' lesbian
So you learn not to yearn and you take it on the chin againHere's what I find about compromise, don't do it if it hurts inside
'Cause either way you're screwed
Eventually you'll find that you may as well feel good
You may as well have some prideCome August we'll go to Cherokee and hear Loretta do her thing
Pack it into the Indian casino and make the hillbilly scene
Kick up our heels and join inAre you my ally or my enemy?
Do you have self-loathin' or empathy?
Can you keep me in your prayers?
Sister, can you keep me in there somewhere?And sister, if you ain't got nothin' good to say
Don't say nothin' at all 
Secure yourself to Heaven
Hold on tight, the night has come
Fasten up your earthly burdens
You have just begunIn the ink of an eye I saw you bleed
Through the thunder I could hear you scream

Hearts and bones from days of youth

Allowed to glide right through the sun
Released from circles guarded tight
Now we all are chosen onesSecure yourself to Heaven

I can go one day without calling
Two days without bawling
Three days without missing
But a lifetime of no kissing you
Is something that I just can't do
I wish I could be there
To share the moonI got more back for the breaking
More callous for making
A lifetime for the aching
I got no need to run this battery down
I'm just trying to get the stains out
I wish I could be there
To share the moonHey la la
I'm gonna love to you till it hurts
I don't mind if I do
Hey la la
I'm gonna love you till it works
I've got no mind to loseTheres one trash heap burning
Fireflies are returning
Nightfall is softly chirping
One trailer light is staying on till dawn
I wonder who it's waiting onI wish I could be there
To share the moonHey la la
I'm gonna love to you till it hurts
So don't mind if I do
Hey la la
I'm gonna love you till it works
I've got no mind to lose 
We were sitting round a dying fire
Somebody lit incense, somebody lit a cigarette
And passed the bottle around
It was just strawberry season
Backbreakin' pickers in the patches
Every thing's burning down to ashes and down to the groundShe's saving me, I don't even think she knows it
It's a strange way to show it as distant
As last night's dream unravels
She's saving me, I'm a very lost soul
I was born with a hole in my heart
The size of my land locked travelsI try to put it aside but it's too much bigger than me
There's a big brown hawk in the tree
Lighting and leaving
And this tea leaves tossing
Heads up pennies in my pocket
Dead star like a rocket, the arc of my grievingShe's saving me, I don't even think she knows it
It's a strange way to show it as distant
As last night's dream unravels
She's saving me, I'm a very lost soul
I was born with a hole in my heart
The size of my land locked travelsThe sky pours out biblical rain
Then days so still the beauty gives you pain
The heatwave kills the green and she remains unseen
But colors up my dream with all things bloomingThis is not all there is, it's not a kingdom
It's not an angry God, it feels like her
It feels like no fear, it feels like no doubt
It feels like inside out, the ashes stirShe's saving me, I don't really think she knows it
It's a strange way to show it as distant
As last night's dream unravels
She's saving me, I'm a very lost soul
I was born with a hole in my heart
As wide as my land locked travels 
One hundred and fifteen
You are seventeen
Itchy trigger
Venomous
You growing longer
You growing stronger
So she'd your skin, baby
Now she'd thisCome on over now
Come on over baby
You tell me it's holy holy

Let's call it the fullness of time
I don't know what that is, come on over nowHey holy, console me
Some power, controls me

Remorse it, I force
It can't free it, so be itHey holy, console me
Some power, controls me
Come on over baby 
Should have never crossed your path
Funny things you want the most
Should soon be taken back
Slap my own hands like a child
Stealing from the candy store
I think I've taken to your smileAnd I hunger for your laugh
Do the craziest things like look around
When I know you're nowhere near me
Break my back on a song
Though I know you're not there to hearUnanswered questions lying on the coffee table
From a song I haven't finished since last summer
Cause I never could decide how much was gin
How much the sea
Or other incidentals clouding what was really meEverything I am is bare feet and burning sand
Waiting for the calm cool hand of the seaA madman of emotions waiting for the drug effect
Of the reason and the intellect to comfort meHalf the time I love you like you love the fall's first breeze
Then you seem as distant as the skeletons of trees
Far away outside my window
Where inside I think of you
As if I thought hard enough I'd know which way to turn
And what to doOoh
Ooh
Ooh
OohI'm quite sure I'll be alright
We all live with some distraction
It's just too bad
Mine will hang around all day and night
Like an uninvited guest
You can't turn away try hard as you might
Lord knows I've triedI might let it go and take a long long run
Quit my job and join the coastline baking in the sun
Then again I might just make big plans
And leave them on the table
Like the song I left unfinished
And the words I am unable
I will always be unable to expressOoh
Ooh
Ooh
Ooh 
Sister I'm heading out of Alabama so you better think fast
Wind is gonna pick me up now and the rain won't slack
I'm heading down to Georgia so don't lose track
Where you've been and where you're going now
Who you've seen and what they lack
Why you come undone every time you go there
You come undone, yeah, yeahI know your heart's in danger and so is your life
I said,"You learn to trust a stranger and stop and rest for the night
Set your sight up in the headlight well the moon won't be enough
And light the embers of another and the night won't seem so rough
Sister"There was a bloody beast of burden on a dark Texas road
A woman in a family way and a car that lost control
I'm studying the distance between the blanket and the gun
I got ten hours to Natchez and another ten home
Well I'm goin' home
YesI know your heart's in danger and so is your life
I said,"You learn to trust a stranger and stop and rest for the night
Set your sight up in the headlight an' the moon won't be enough
And light the embers of another and the night won't seem so rough
Sister"Go ahead
I said,"Come on"
Ah hoo yea
Ah hoo yea
Ah hoo yea
Ah hoo yeaI said,"It's trust that brought me here
And trust will bring me home" 
If you ever feel you'll lose your dreams
Or your hope seems too far gone
I'll bring the distance to your door
You couldn't ask for any moreYou were around when I needed a friend
You were the means you were the end
You'll be the one I'll turn to now
There's gonna be some hard times coming downWithout you the world would be so crowded
Without you the moon would be so clouded
Without you I can be anyone
Anyone at all but myselfIf ever your candle won't blow out
Or your sorrow seems so interrupted
Well I'll be the first to bring the darkness down
I'll be the silence at your sideWithout you the music couldn't move me
The words would ring true
But the tune would feel so empty
Without you I can be anyone
Anyone at all but myself
But myselfWish I was a slow moving sea
Moving away from the land so cautiously
I'd find me an island to surround
Just like you did as I was feeling down
As I was feeling downWithout you the world would be so crowded
Without you the moon would be so clouded
Without you I can be anyone
Anyone at all but myself
Oh but myselfWish I was a slow moving sea
Wish I was a slow moving sea
Love is like a slow moving sea
Keeping in touch with eternity
Wish I was a slow, slow, slow, slow moving sea
Love is like a slow moving sea 
I've seen the sun on a funeral, the full moon in a midday sky
Tactician politician hold his head and wonder why
I'm always struck that much harder by the power of suggestionBy now I know the answer's always in the question
Now that we're done with that, why don't you warm the car
All of the fields are filled with fresh boys playing football
More than the weather chills, the bands practicing their drillsI've got to get back to something real with you
I had to call your parents to get your number again
I was either gonna be the prodigal or the banished friend
We were standing against an outside wall, I was afraid of what you'd say
It took me ten years to call you back but here we are todayNow that we're done with that, why don't you warm the car
All of the fields are filled with fresh boys playing football
More than the weather chills, the bands practicing their drillsI've got to get back to something real with youSo life has brought you this: two marriages and three kids
And me life as slick as ice that finally hit the skids
You're as sweet as you ever were
A slight sickness of regret washes over me
And in the end that's all I getNow that we're done with that, why don't you warm the car
All of the fields are filled with fresh boys playing football
More than the weather chills, the bands practicing their drillsI've got to get back to something real
I've got to get back to something real
I've got to get back to something real with you 
Kelly mountain road saw a heavy load
With a sagging heart and a break apart
Voices in me stood as thick as thieves
With no sympathy for the beggars' artI have passed these pines
'Bout a million times effortlessly
Now I grip the wheel fear is what I feel
At the slow unraveling of beingBut you tell me it's temporary, it's a matter of time
By God don't you think I know it's in my mind?
And it's right over left and healing the then
I'll soon be to nothing but I don't know whenWell, the way I flee on my crooked feet
Barn happy horse on a one-track course
Then I self despise, cryin' out my eyes
'Cause the happy trail led me to remorseBut the road is long and the song is gone
I blow empty in my cicada shell
If I saw my choice, I might find my voice
But I don't know when and I just can't tellBut you tell me it's temporary, it's a matter of time
By God don't you think I know it's in my mind?
It's right over left and healing the then
I'll soon be to nothing but I don't know whenDeep behind my face is a safer place
But old gears are hitched tight to the gate
It's a daily grind waiting to unwind
Till I hear that click that unlocks my fateYeah, but you tell me it's temporary and it's a matter of time
By God, don't you think I know it's in my mind?
It's right over left and healing the then
I'll soon be to nothing but I don't know whenI'll soon be to nothing but I don't know when
I'll soon be to nothing but I don't know when 
 
Southern man better keep your head
Don't forget what your good book said
Southern change gonna come as last
Now your crosses are burning fast
Southern manI saw cotton
I saw black
Tall white fences
Little shacks
And southern man
When will you pay them back
I heard screaming
Bull whips cracking
How long how long
HowSouthern man better keep your head
Don't forget what your good book said
Southern change gonna come at last
Now your crosses are burning fast
Southern man
Southern manLilly belle your hair is golden brown
I've seen your black man coming round
I swear by God I'm gonna cut him down
I heard screaming
Bull whips cracking
How long how long
How 
Maybe we'll make Texas by the morning
Light the Bayou with our tail lights in the night
800 miles to El Paso from the state line
And we never have the money for the flightI'm in the back seat, sleepy from the travel
Played our hearts out all night long in New Orleans
And I'm dirty from the diesel fumes, drinking coffee black
When the first breath of Texas comes in cleanAnd there's something 'bout the southland in the springtime
Where the waters flow with confidence and reason
Though I miss her when I'm gone, it won't ever be too long
Till I'm home again to spend my favorite seasonWhen God made me born a yankee, he was teasin'
There's no place like home and none more pleasin'
Than the southland in the springtimeIn Georgia nights are softer than a whisper
Beneath the quilt somebody's mother made by hand
With the farmland like a tapestry passed down through generations
And the peach trees stitched across the landThere'll be cider up near Helen off the roadside
And boiled peanuts in a bag to warm your fingers
And the smoke from the chimneys meets it's maker in the sky
With a song that winter wrote whose melody lingersAnd there's something 'bout the southland in the springtime
Where the waters flow with confidence and reason
Though I miss her when I'm gone, it won't ever be too long
Till I'm home again to spend my favorite seasonWhen God made me born a yankee he was teasin'
There's no place like home and none more pleasin'
Than the southland in the springtime 
 
If you were here in Starkville
Townie boys would love the way you stare
If you were here in Starkville
Well the local girls they wouldn't have a prayerWell I've spent a reckless night inside the wonder
Of your everlasting charm
Now I'm haunted by geography and the flora
And the fauna of your heartAt the dawning of some road worn day
I call you on a whim just to say
The morning birds are singing
But I could not do them justice
So I hung up and I fell back to sleepBut I'm in love with my mobility
Sometimes this life can be a drag
Like when I noticed your nobility and how my leaving
It only held you backBut I remember one occasion
When you were drinking
And you asked me to the coast
But I was hell bent on agony back then
And so I missed the boatAt the dawning of some road worn day
I call you on a whim just to say
My regrets become distractions
When I can not do them justice
Then I hung up and I fell back to sleepWhen I was down in Starkville
I was hiding out inside some comfort inn
From a local gang of troubadours
When the homecoming queen
She come ridin' in yeahYeah but I slipped out of my room into the rain
And I went running for my health
I watched those headlights turn to moonlight
And finally I was running by myselfNow it's the dawning of some road worn day
And I call you on a whim just to say
The morning birds are singing 
I come to you with strange fire
I make an offering of love
The incense of my soul is burned
By the fire in my bloodI come with a softer answer
To the questions that lie in your path
I want to harbor you from the anger
Find a refuge from the wrathThis is a message, a message of love
Love that moves from the inside out
Love that never grows tired
I come to you with strange fire, fireMercenaries of the shrine
Now who are you to speak for God?
With haughty eyes and lying tongues
And hands that shed innocent bloodNow who delivered you the power
To interpret calvary
You gamble away our freedom
To gain your own authorityFind another state of mind
Reach out to grab hold
Strange fire burns
With the motion of loveWhen you learn to love yourself
You will dissolve all the stones that are cast
Now you will learn to burn the icing sky
To melt the waxen maskI said to have the gift of true release
There's a peace that will take you higher
I come to you with my offering
I bring you strange fireThis is a message, a message of love
Love that moves from the inside out
Love that never grows tired
I come to you with strange fire
Fire, fire
Come to you with strange fire 
All the fur and fin will lose again
'Cause our better is their worst reckonin'
And our fine-feathered friends
Will sing until they bleed
And how will we replace that symphony?I've got the blackest boots, the whitest skin
Satisfy my sugar tongue again
Bring me love that buys us shoe-shine days
Guilded verses for your ethylene
And sing it to me free and cleanAll the kids come home with foreign limbs
From hunting trips abroad they lose again
And we'll teach them how to talk
And whistle while they walk
And do the dirty work of battle hymnsI've got the blackest boots, the whitest skin
Satisfy my sugar tongue again
Sing me love that buys us shoe-shine days
Guilded verses for your ethylene
And sing it to me free and cleanDrinking tea with milk and Janjaweed
Pontificate on genocide or greed
With a spoonful of descent
For the orchestra of need
Is just enough to please this colonyI've got the blackest boots, the whitest skin
Satisfy my sugar tongue again
Bring me lullabies and morphine-dreams
Belladonna with her atropine
And sing it to me free and clean 
"Summertime" is a George Gershwin song. To be more accurate
(admittedly, only slightly more - I don't actually know what I'm
talking about - haven't y'all figured that out by now?), the music is
by George Gershwin, and the lyrics are by somebody who's last name is
"Heyward." That's what I'm told. And I may be TOTALLY wrong here,
but I THINK it MAY be from "Porgy and Bess." Anyway, the girls have
been doing this song about as long as any other song... Since at
least '85 or '86. Occasionally, back in the good ol' days, this used
to feature a killer flute solo by Ms. Annie "what a babe" Richardson,
or a harmonica solo by Mr. Sandy "all the best harmonica players
suck" Garfinkle. And if you were REALLY lucky, you'd get to see a
ten-minute jam with BOTH of 'em. And, if you were REALLY REALLY
lucky, then Ms. DeDe "this bass is taller than I am" Vogt would be
there to provide a stylin' bass line and to point out that despite
what the lyric says, cotton is high in the springtime. Ah... I DO
miss those days. Anyway, enough nostalgia...
Summertime.
Summertime, and the living is easy
The fish are jumping, the cotton is high
Your daddy's rich, your mama's good looking
I said, hush, little baby, don't you cry.
One of these mornings, you're bound to rise up singing
Then you'll spread your wings, and take to the sky
But until that morning, nothing's going to harm you, no
With your daddy and mama standing by. 
They say that these are not the best of times
But they're the only times I've ever known
And I believe there is a time for meditation in cathedrals of our own
Now I have seen that sad surrender in my lover's eyes
And I can only stand apart and sympathize
For we are always what our situations hand us
It's either sadness or euphoriaAnd so we'll argue and we'll compromise
And realize nothing's ever changed
For all our mutual experience our separate conclusions are the same
Now we are forced to recognize our inhumanity
Reason co-exists with our insanity
And when we choose between reality and madness
It's either sadness or euphoriaHow thoughtlessly we dissipate our energies
Perhaps we don't fulfill each other's fantasies
And as we stand upon the ledges of our lives
With our respective similarities
It's either sadness or euphoria
Oh oh oh
Oh oh
Oh oh
Oh oh oh 
Sweet gypsy blowing through my mind
And through my heart so full and empty
Well these days seem strange somehow
A billion years isn't what it appears to beNow you tell me that you're losing hold of time
You can't seem to find your peace of mind
Well I'm so far away and I'm trying to see you through
I can't help but feel I may be losing youShould I let you go
For your own sake
Should I hold you close
For mineAnyway I love you and I couldn't be more sure
These tears cry out "please don't let go"
Oh but their words
They keep haunting meYou can't build your life around a dream
Well it's too late
Now my world is you
There's nothing they could say or doWell I remember the first time that I fell
I swear I never thought I'd make it up again
I've been flying on the wings of your love
And I'm not getting down just to fall againDon't it seem like the road is oh so long
Well everybody's moving out
And we're staying on
In this absurdityNow you don't let go of me
I'm begging you
Now you don't let go of meAnyway I love you 
Whatever it was, it wasn't manumission
To spill the blood, to pull the weed
You can bury the past, but it's a mausoleum
With the ghost of a fist that won't let us beCan we bring it together
Can we call from the mountain to the valley below?
Can we make it better
Do we tether the hawk, do we tether the dove?I kicked up the dirt, and I said to my neighbor
We keep making it worse, we keep getting it wrong
He tucked in his shirt, he stood a little bit straighter
We need a few less words dear, we need a few more gunsWill it bring us together
Can we call from the mountain to the valley below?
Can we make it better
Do we tether the hawk, do we tether the dove?Enduring love
Why so much and so strong, beyond this short existence?
Don't be still
You say there's a long line behind you
And it's hardly worth the mentioning
But I will'Cause we may flicker and fade
But we never will be through with this
I see this world battered but not broken
There's a fallow heart, it's waiting on a sowing hand
You can grow what you want
One day it's gonna rise up
So plant what you need to make a better standAnd we'll bring it together
And we'll call from the mountain to the valley below
And we'll make it better
Let go of the hawk, we let go of the doveCan bring it together
Call from the mountain to the valley below
I'm telling you now
And we'll make it better
Do we tether the hawk, do we tether the dove? 
 
I'm scared as hell,
'Cause Squeaky's out of jail.
I can feel her close behind me,
Like the devil on my heels.
They say she's heading for California,
Or maybe for DC;
I'm sittin' here down in Georgia,
Arguing with my family.
The contras called a truce,
But they broke it in an hour;
And now someone's sittin' in the Tower of Babel,
He's givin' them that power.
They stop the war in Bethlehem,
Just to let sweet Jesus pass;
But how much does he really mean,
When they screw him over behind his back?
I can feel 'em closin' in,
And I hope she understands,
That society and me,
Now we aren't necessarily hand in hand.
She's broken all her bonds,
Got no superficial causes,
She gave up all her chances,
To live inside the law.
Squeaky, peace on earth -
Will you tell me what it's worth?
From the inside out I'd let you in
I think that you might understand.
Squeaky, in your mixed-up mind,
You may not be so blind.
From the inside out I'd let you in
I think that you might understand -
That God is in my heart,
But the Devil is in my bones.
And Squeaky, you are not alone.
(Ad lib to end.) 
Time where have you left me
Here without a heart
Without an answer
I tried to open my eyes
I tried to see the song
All things considered
This much remains the sameHit that wall again
The same old barrier
Time after time I've tried
To glimpse the other side
Oh and time surely made me see
I was taking your love so carelessly
Now we know
Though it doesn't do much good anymore
I still feel the old familiar painIt could be that love is blind
I was blind to all your reasoning
But at the start you were blind to me
Now I guess you could say we're even
Isn't that what we always wanted to be
Putting our souls on the line to win this game
I'm feeling the strainI'll always love you
Through all this distance
All these barriers
Trying to erase the pain
Erase the pain
Erase the pain 
She won't recover from her losses
She's not chosen this path but she watches who it crosses
Maybe move to the right, maybe move to the left
So we can all see her pain, she wears like a banner on her chest
And we all say, "It's sad" and we think it's a shame
And she's called to our attention but we do not call her name
The girl with the weight of the world in her hands'Cause we're busy with our happiness and busy with our plans
I wonder if alone she wants it taken from her hands
But if things didn't keep getting harder
She might miss her sacred chance to go a consecrated martyr
The girl with the weight of the world in her handsI wonder which saint that lives inside a bead
Will grant her consolation when she counts upon her need
It makes us all angry though we feign to care
But who will be the scale to weigh the cross she has to bear
The girl with the weight of the world in her handsIs the glass half-full or empty, I ask her as I fill it
She said it doesn't really matter, pretty soon you're bound to spill it
With the half logic language of the sermon she delivers
And the way she smiles so knowingly at me, gives me the shivers
I pull the blanket higher when I'm finally safe at home
And she'll take a hundred with her but she always sleeps alone
The girl with the weight of the world in her hands 
Show a little inspiration
Show a little spark
Show the things that drew me to you
And stole my heart
And tell me something I don't know
Instead of everything I do
And look at me as if I mean
Something to you
Our hearts are beating while we sleep
But while we're wide awake
You know the world won't stop
And actions speak louder
Listen to your heart
To what your heart might say
Everything we got
We got the hard wayShow a little passion baby
Show a little style
Show the knack for knowing when
And the gift for knowing how
And have a little trust in us
When fear obscures the path
You know we got this far darling
Not by luck
But by never turning back
Some will call on destiny
But I just call on faith
That the world won't stop
And actions speak louder
Listen to your heart
To what your heart might say
Everything you got
You got the hard wayCaught up in our little lives
There's not a lot left over
I see what's missing in your eyes
You're searching for that
Field of cloverSo show a little inspiration
Show a little spark
Show the world a little light
When you show it your heart
We've got two lives
One we're given
And the other one we make
And the world won't stop
And actions speak louder
Listen to your heart
And your heart might say
Everything we got
We got the hard way
(everything we got we got the hard way)
Everything we got
We got the hard way 
Tonight I've been sleepin on the mountain top
With a billion stars for my witness
In the morning I go down as the sun comes up
I take a drink from the bitter root riverHave you been lonely
Yes I've been lonely
Yes I've been lonely tooSaid now have you been lonely
Yes I've been lonely
Yes I've been lonely tooYeah well tonight I've been sleepin on the mountain top
With a billion stars for my witness
In the morning I go down as the sun comes up
I take a drink from the bitter root riverSometimes been lonely
Sometimes been lonely
Sometimes been lonely too
Sometimes been lonely
Sometimes been lonely
Sometimes been lonely tooTonight I've been sleepin on the mountain top
Yeah I got a million stars for my witness
In the morning I go down as the sun comes up
I take a drink from the bitter root riverHave we been workin
Yes we been workin
Yes we been workin too
I said have we been workin
Yes I been workin
Have we been workin too 
They called you "The rise of the Black Messiah" like so many boys before you
And they'll be more, more to follow threatening and hard to swallowI'm sitting underneath that hanging tree, just me and the ghost of the KKK
Poor man's gallows in the middle of the woods - the saddest tree that ever stoodMy friend I heard you tell of slavery's end but have you heard of mass incarceration
That ol' Jim Crow he just keeps getting born with a new hanging rope for the black man's scourgeHey Ol' Man River what do you know of that plantation they call Angloa?
The devil spawned a prison there - the saddest farm that ever livedYour great-granddaddy he worked that land with shackles on his feet and on hands
He built them levees he chopped that can he died in the mud in his chains
Now you stand where he once stood shackles on you all the sameBut he's gonna rise, he's gonna rise and all them lynchers are gonna be damned
When outta that mud walks a brand new manThey called you "The Rise of the Black Messiah" and said they'd do any damn
thing they could to keep ya-
You and your brothers from spreading the word, the gospel of freedom and
Black man's worth40 years in solitary, consider the man they just can't bury
I got this letter in my hand, saying tell this story when you canHe's gonna rise, he's gonna rise and all them lynchers are gonna be damned
When outta that hold walks a brand new man 
I tried my best to get over you
Kept my distance so I wouldn't have to show
That the things which I kept hidden
By my casual smile
Were the things that I needed you to know.
You could have seen the acting on the stage
You could have read the writing on the page
You could have noticed that a heart went breaking into two
But you never knew it was I was falling for you.
Sometimes I still think that I could get to you
Then I laugh, and think I could swim the seven seas
It seems when I'm set to fly, there's a storm up in the sky
When I'm set to sail, there isn't any breeze.
You could have seen the acting on the stage
You could have read the writing on the page
You could have noticed that a heart went breaking into two
But you never knew it was I was falling for you.
(solo)
It's been some time now that I saw you in a photograph
Looking just the way you did so long ago
I could almost see you throw your head back
And start to laugh in that gentle way that used to let me know
Things were okay, and a hurting song is just a cliche
And what's the use if they only always fade away
Just like the sun - just like everyone - but you 
The water is wide, I can't cross o'er
And neither I have wings to fly
Give me a boat that can carry two
And both shall row - my love and I
Now love is gentle, and love is kind
The sweetest flower when first it's new
But love grows old, and waxes cold
And fades away like morning dew
There is a ship, she sails the sea
She's loaded deep as deep can be
But not as deep as the love I'm in
I know not how I sink or swim
The water is wide, I can't cross o'er
And neither I have wings to fly
Give me a boat that can carry two
And both shall row - my love and I
And both shall row - my love and I. 
I'm not the sort of person who falls in and quickly out of love
But to you, I give my affection, right from the start.
I have a lover who loves me - how could I break such a heart?
Yet still you get my attention.
Why do you come here, when you know I've got troubles enough?
Why do you call me, when you know I can't answer the phone?
And make me lie when I don't want to,
And make someone else some kind of an unknowing fool?
Make me stay when I should not?
If you're so strong then resolve the weakness in me.
Why do you come here, and pretend to be just passing by?
I need to see you - I need to hold you - tightly.
Feeling guilty,
And I'm worried, and I'm waking from a tormented sleep
'Cause this old love, you know it has me bound,
But this new love cuts so deep.
If I choose now, I'm bound to lose out;
One of you is gonna have to fall...
I need you, baby.
Why do you come here, when you know I've got troubles enough?
Why do you call me, when you know I can't answer the phone?
And make me lie when I don't want to,
And make someone else some kind of an unknowing fool?
Make me stay when I should not?
If you're so strong then resolve the weakness in me.
Why do you come here, and pretend to be just passing by?
I need to see you - I need to hold you - tightly 
For Christmas my love gave me a stocking sewn of sack cloth hung on a nail
The simplest gift warm by the fire best of a kindness least prevailedWill my love fill it with silver? Will my love fill it with gold?
or will my love just fill it with wonder for the humble prince born to this worldI walked a path on down to the river well into midnight on a Christmas eve
to hear the beasts and birds of the forest telling the story of the star in the east
The brightest star in one true sky, the simplest gift one cold night
Will that night just fill me with wonder for the humble prince born to this worldWe gather round the tree in the morning strung with berries and popped corn from the fields
It gave itself from over on the mountain to bring us joy and hallow the mealWHat if this tree that's gathered us together, what if this tree withstood the storm
What if this joy that don't leave no wanting and fills us with wonder on this Christmas mornWell my love, I don't need silver
Well my love, I don't need gold
For my love I'm filled with the wonder for the humble prince born to this world
For my girl I'm filled with the wonder, filled with the wonder, filled with the wonder, filled with the wonder
on this Christmas morn. 
The thin horizon of a plan is almost clear
My friends and I have had a tough time
Bruising our brains hard up against change
All the old dogs and the magicianNow I see we're in the boat in two-by-two's
Only the heart that we have for a tool we could use
And the very close quarters are hard to get used to
Love weighs the hull down with its weightBut the wood is tired, and the wood is old
And we'll make it fine, if the weather holds
But if the weather holds, we'll have missed the point
That's where I need to goNo way construction of this tricky plan
Was built by other than a greater hand
With a love that passes all our understanding
Watching closely over the journeyYeah, but what it takes to cross the great divide
Seems more that all the courage I can muster up inside
But we got to have some answers when we reach the other side
The prize is always worth the rocky rideBut the wood is tired, and the wood is old
And we'll make it fine, if the weather holds
But if the weather holds, we'll have missed the point
That's where I need to goSometimes I ask to sneak a closer look
Skip to the final chapter of the book
And then maybe steer us clear from some of the pain it took
To get us where we are this far, this farBut the question drowns in its futility
Even I have got to laugh at me
No one gets to miss the storm of what will be
Just holding on for the rideBut the wood is tired, and the wood is old
And we'll make it fine, if the weather holds
But if the weather holds, we'll have missed the point
That's where I need to go 
I brought my tree down to the shore
The garland and the silver star
To find my peace and grieve no more
To heal this place inside my heartOn every branch I laid some bread
And hungry birds filled up the sky
They rang like bells around my head
They sang my spirit back to lifeOne tiny child can change the world
One shining light can show the way
Through all my tears, for what I've lost
There's still my joy
There's still my joy for Christmas dayThe snow comes down on empty sand
There's tinsel moonlight on the waves
My soul was lost but here I am
So this must be amazing grace 
They won't have me but I love this place
Rural life is broken and the farmlands gone to chaff
My hands are idle and my mind needs rest
Toil of the decent and the sleep of the bestI sit in diners with all the old men in it
They talk of work 'cause it's all they ever did
They gave their hearts to Jesus and got serious
And they gave up their drinking and they worked for thisNothing, nothing
And it's all this love to offer
And all this love to waste
And all this love to offer
And all this love to wasteLame dog on the highway where the old road used to be
You know what divides us is just a difference someone made
Some got tired of trying, some were just too scared to stay
But we gave ourselves to nothing and we let 'em have their dayNow who's gonna do the planting
And who's gonna pray for rain?
And who's gonna keep the farmland
From the sub-division man?Nothing, nothing
Nothing, nothing
And it's all this love to offer
And all this love to waste 
i thought the time was passed when i could
find beauty in a birds
i set the stage and the scenery
rehearsing every word
yeah but when i tried to make it more
well it was always less
and it's a thin line between pleasing yourself
and pleasing somebody else
oh yeah
oh yeah
all right
with my confidence on fire
i set to fixin' up my roles
my separation of desires
just left me deeper down in the hole
yeah when i tried to make it more
well it was always less
and it's a thin line between pleasing yourself
and pleasing somebody else
yeah and when i tried to make it more
well it was always less
it's a thin line between pleasing yourself
and pleasing somebody else
now i'm tryin to get back
to what i know that i should be
hoping to God that i was just
a temporary absentee
yeah when i tried to make it more
well it was always less
it's a thin line between pleasing yourself
and pleasing somebody else
yeah when i tried to make it more
well it was always less
and it's a thin line between pleasing yourself
and pleasing somebody else
somebody else oh yeah
oh yeah
all right 
It's a fish white belly

I drive a three county highway
And every one of them town's got a firework show
It's 4th of July and I'm just now getting home
On the horizon I can see them all unfoldIt's been a warm winter and a cold spring
Everywhere I've been has felt wrong to me
Everything I kept
What I never should have thrown away
I wanted you for all those yesterdaysI was wishing for you one Sunday morning
Walkin' down the road in some debtor's town
From every church a hymn came blendin' and
Everyone of them wantin' to be foundDid you say it took a long time to find
A lot less man and less harm done?
Did you say it took a long time to find
A handsome one to keep you young?One day I'm gonna make it up to you
One day we're gonna laugh instead of cry
One day I'm coming home to stay, it's true
And baby that's the last ticket I'm ever gonna buy'Cause it's been a warm winter and a cold spring
Everywhere I've been has felt wrong to me
So put your head on my heart, lay down in the crook of my arm and
Everything's okay, I've been found again
I've been found again 
Three hits to the heart son
And it's poetry in motion
One could send you down the river
Three's a strange way to be deliveredWould you trade your words for freedom?
That's a barter for a blind man
Three hits to the heart son
And it's poetry in motionAre you leveed like a treasure?
Only words can help me find you
And this world's a fickle measure
I will painfully remind youFrom a wise man to your red hand
You lay covered in our best sins
Three hits to the heart son
And it's poetry in motionWell I dream you constant stranger
With your best bloods and your anger
You say, "Mother do you claim me?"
My beloved do you blame me?
Well the first two might release you
But the last one sings in me sonThree hits to the heart son
And it's poetry in motion
Three hits to the heart son
And the last one sings in me 
Her life is a show
One act follows the other everywhere she goes
She takes the leading role
She never plays herself
Save for the time she's on the stageColor her black or white
Now either one reflects the teardrops
One extreme for the other
Nothing in between
Color her white for the princess she could be
Color her black for the troubled child she plays so well
Well she's dancing through hell on a dreamAnd blue is soul of the one
Reaching for the man that she hasn't got yet
And holding on to those hearts for lost causes
She could be so bright
But she's reaching for us all
Color her blue for the loneliness she feels
She's hiding her heart in the skyAnd this is a thursday afternoon
It's just another thursday afternoon
It's just another thursday afternoonColor me grey
I'm a little bit of everything today
And I'm not sure just where I'm going
Color me grey
Wishing I was something more of distinctionColor us all 'cause we're just stars
Wishing our lives away
Into the distance
And out of existenceColor her black or white
Color her blue
Or color me grey
Color us all - we're stars
Wishing our lives away
Now we're stars 
Ohh yeah
From baby to best with no second test
These little storms destroy you
And here is the fame they promised to give you
Takin' the place of my hand nowWell, did you try to be true?
What separates me from you now
What separates me from youDid you borrow the soul?
The soul that you sell now
What does your conscience tell you?
Where are the demons of your desires?
Why does my love destroy you?I said, I tried to be true
What separates me from you now?
(What separates me from you now?)
I said, I tried, tried to be true
What separates me from you now
(What separates me from you now?)
What separates me from you
(What separates me from you now?)
I think it's you nowTell me, where is the fame?
Where is the fortune?
Where is the world that denies you?
Who is to blame?
When my heart finally forfeits
To a road that will only misguide youWell, did we try to be true?
What separates me from you now?
(What separates me from you now?)
Oh, did we try, try to be true?
(What separates me from you now?)
(What separates me from you now?)
It separates me from you now
(What separates me from you now?)
It separates me from you
(What separates me from you now?)
It's youWhere are they, Baby?
Where are they, Baby?
Where are they, Baby?
Baby, baby
Yeah(I tried, tried to be true)
Yeah, I bought my love a hunger
More precious than a stone
(I tried, tried to be true)
Where is the world that denies you?
All these fatal flowers
(I tried, tried to be true)
Where is the world that denies you?
Did I misguide you?
(Tried to be true) 
Trouble came around here
Here in the South we fix something to eat
Steam risin' up off the greenery
And we welcome the strangers we meet
Alien sick growing in these walls
Like moss in a crack that time made
I brush a guy in the airport whistling it's a small world after all
And the prices are higher but the kids still selling lemonadeGet to the point of it
Get to the sense of it
I'm in a hurry to get through itA hurricane flag flappin' in a bad storm
Same color of the spider underneath my nail that bit me in my dream
And who would take out the Dominican Republic
And send God's sweet children floating down a poison stream
Secret society of conference rooms
I pledge my allegiance to the dollar
And when the clergy take a vote all the gays will pay again, yeah
'Cause there's more than one kind of criminal white collarTo get to the point of it
Get to the sense of it
I'm in a hurry to get through itOne day the war will stop
And we'll grow a peaceful crop
And a girl can get a wife
And we can bring you back to life
Sacks of flour and rice or poker chips
Greasy palms and systems underhanding
And maybe we'll take a walk on Pluto
But be no closer to the understandingAnd get to the point of it
Get to the sense of it
I'm in a hurry to get through it yeah 
Baby, I got the best intentions
But I just can't do it
Baby, I got the truest aim
But I just can't winBaby, I got a good vibration
But I just can't play it
Baby, I spent my only fortune
On the wages of sinSo you, you gotta be extra forgivin'
And you gotta be super strong
You gotta be true romantic
I want you to look the other way
Everythin' goes wrongBaby, you took all the good stuff
And put it all together
And you took all the bad stuff
And you threw it all awayWould I still be the girl
That suits your fancy?
Would I still be the boy
Who rocks your world?If you get lonely, the trouble and the chaos
If you get bored, since you walked away
Remember what I told you
When the night was darkened
You can leave me all you need to
Baby, I'm here to stayBaby, I'm gonna be extra forgiving
And I'm gonna be super strong
'Cause baby, I'm, I'm a true romantic
I'm gonna look the other way
When everything goes wrong 
Tuesday's children
We're falling short of time
Let's hope we never fall short of love
Memories linger like the fog on the sea
Keeping me out of touch with my reality
Nothing could ever mean as much to me
As tuesday's childrenSometimes I feel like I'm falling short of myself
Who I am
What I choose to be
Most of the time tuesday's children
Brings it all back and down to meThese people
These friends of ours
Let's put them on another day
Just leave me tuesdays children
I can face the world my own wayTimes like these make me wish
Everyday was a tuesday
Tuesday's children
You've been so good to me
Tuesday's children 
Well, the first days are the hardest days, don't you worry anymore
'Cause when life looks like easy street, there is danger at your door
Now think this through with me, let me know your mind
Whoa oh, what I want to know is, are you kindNow it's a buck dancer's choice, my friends, better take my advice
You know all the rules by now and the fire from the ice
Now will you come with me, won't you come with me?
Whoa oh, what I want to know, will you come with me?Sister, well, I declare, have you seen the like
Their walls are built of cannon balls, their motto is ''Don't tread on me"
Come hear uncle John's band playing to the tide
Come with me or go alone, he's come to take his children homeIt's the same story the crow told me, it's the only one he knows
Like the morning sun you come and like the wind you go
Ain't no time to hate, barely time to wait
Whoa oh, what I want to know, where does the time go?I live in a silver mine and I call it beggar's tomb
I've got me a violin and I beg you call the tune
Anybody's choice, I can hear your voice
Whoa oh, what I want to know, how does the song go?Come hear uncle John's band by the riverside
Got some things to talk about here beside the rising tide
Come hear uncle John's band, playing to the tide
Come on, come on or go alone, he's come to take his children homeWhoa oh, what I want to know, how does the song go?Come hear uncle John's band by the riverside
Got some things to talk about here beside the rising tide
Come hear uncle John's band playing to the tide
Come on along or go alone, he's come to take his children homeCome hear uncle John's band by the riverside
(Brother, ain't no time to hate)
Got some things to talk about here beside the rising tide
(Sister, ain't no time to wait)
Come hear uncle John's band playing to the tide
Come on along or go alone, he's come to take his children homeOh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh 
They took away my garden
To make room for a chemical plant
I feel my country's arteries harden
With the aid of a government grant
Chorus:
We are not a bunch of upstarts
Just out l
ooking for a cause
We hunger for our justice
And not applause
We don't just make peace signs and meditate
We don't take this thing as a joke
We just want to relate - we're in a pretty bad state
And we don't want to go up in smoke
My water has got cancer
And the rivers have all dried
While I watch my country practice
Nuclear suicide
Chorus
Don't think it's impossible
To see this thing come clean
We're going to save this poor old world's head
From the guillotine
Chorus/Solo
They took away my garden
(My water has got cancer)
To make room for a chemical plant
(And the rivers have all dried)
I feel my country's arteries harden
(While I watch my country practice)
Nuclear suicide
Chorus
Oh Lord, we don't want to see our children go up in smoke 
When this old world starts a getting me down
And people are just too much for me to face
I climb way up to the top of the stairs
And all my cares just drift right into spaceOn the roof it's peaceful as can be
And there the world below don't bother me
Oh noSo when I come home feeling tired and beat
I go up where the air is fresh and sweet
And get far away from the hustling crowd
And all that rat race noise down in the streetOn the roof that's the only place I know
Where you just have to wish to make it so
Let's go up on the roofAt night the stars they put on a show for free
Yes they do
And darling you can share it all with meThat's what I said I keep on telling you
That right smack dab in the middle of town
I found a paradise that's trouble free
And if this old world stars getting you down
There's room enough for two up on the roofAt night the stars they put on a show for free yeah
And darling you can share it all with meThat's what I said I keep on telling you
That right smack dab in the middle of town
I found a paradise that's trouble free
If this old world stars getting you down
There's room enough for two up on the roof
Up on the roof oh yeah
Up on the roof 
Some will strut and some will fret
See this an hour on the stage
Others will not but they'll sweat
In their hopelessness in their rage
We're all the same men of anger
And the women of the pageThey published your diary
And that's how I got to know you
The key to the room of your own
And a mind without endAnd here's a young girl
On a kind of a telephone line through time
And the voice at the other end
Comes like a long lost friendSo I know I'm alright
Life will come and life will go
Still I feel it's alright
'Cause I just got a letter to my soulAnd when my whole life is on the tip of my tongue
Empty pages for the no longer young
The apathy of time laughs in my face
You say "Each life has it's place"The hatches were battened
The thunder clouds rolled and the critics stormed
The battle surrounded the white flag of your youth
If you need to know that you weathered the storm
Of cruel mortality
A hundred years later I'm sittin' here living proofSo you know you're alright
(Life will come and go)
Life will come and life will go
Still you'll feel it's alright
(Someone gets your soul)
Someone'll get a letter to your soulWhen your whole life is on the tip of your tongue
Empty pages for the no longer young
The apathy of time laughed in your face
Did you hear me say "Each life has its place"?The place where you hold me
Is dark in a pocket of truth
The moon had swallowed the sun
And the light of the earthAnd so it was for you
When the river eclipsed your life
And sent your soul like a message
In a bottle to me
And it was my rebirthSo we know we're alright
Though life will come, life will go
Still you'll feel it's alright
(Someone gets your soul)
Someone'll will get a letter to your soul(An' when my whole life is on the tip of my tongue)
An' when you know you're alright
And you feel you're alright
(Empty pages for the no longer young)
You'll say dry our eyes
(You said)(And you said)
And you feelin' dry your eyes
(Each life has it's place)
You know it's all right
(It'll be alright)
And it's all riiight 
We use to walk in each other arms
"It was one on one," That's what you said
Now the moon is a sliver in our eye
We stumble bleeding on this broken glassThere was too much repetition
(Over and over and over again)
You know we're past the point of sane
(Over and over and over again)
And all this broken glass you left behind
Won't let you make a clean, clean
I said, "Walk away"Now we're crossing from the sacred ground
Where we once held each other, and each other's names
And the words are sparse, and we feel so profound
But babe you know all I feel, honey I feel so ashamedAh 'cause there was, there was too much repetition
Ah you know, you know, you know
You know we're past the point of sane
Ah oh
All this broken glass we left behind
It won't let us make a clean, cleanI said, "Walk away"
Ah yeah walk away
Oh no walk away
Baby, baby walk away
Ah oh
I said, "Walk away"
Walk away
Oh no walk away
Baby, baby walk awayThere was a time when we gave everything
And it was true babe, true enough to bleed
(True enough to bleed baby)
But now you feel that you've got nothing left
If there's nothing to lose babe
Ah babe, don't you know by now?
Then there's nothing to gain
Ah no walk away
Oh no, walk away
Oh baby baby, walk awayYou know, I'd still hold you if I could
It's hard not to try and change, try to change your mind
I'm a pillar of salt and I want you to understand me
'Cause honey this is the last time, it's the last timeI never look behind
Ah yeah, walk away
Ah no walk away
Baby, baby walk away
All right
Let's goAh I said, "Walk away"
Ah yeah walk away
Ah no walk away
Baby, baby walk away
Ah no I said, "Walk away"
(Don't you know we used to walk)
Come on now baby walk away
(In each others arms)I said, "Close your eyes walk away"
(Hand in hand)
Baby, baby try to listen to me I want to tell you
(That's what you said to be baby yeah)
Now walk away
(Now the moon)
Ah yeah walk away
(Is a sliver in our eyes)
Try to learn to look inside walk away
(And we stumble)
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
(Walking on broken glass)I said "Walk away"
Come on now baby, walk away
I said, "Listen to me"
Walk away baby baby
Now I've got somethin' that I want to tell you
Walk away
Ah no, walk away
Ah baby
I said, "You've got to know by now"
Come on 
It's over, hang your gun down
And eat this simple fare
What you need is to feed on something
Warm and hand preparedThe ice at the edges
Waters, change is near
And send you, give in to
And free your long imprisoned tearsWalk your valley, walk your shadow
Afraid but on your feet
'Til your fire in the sky meetSo sick mad seas made me
Tossed at such a clip
How I clung to you, horizon
The captain of my shipYour flame never faltered
Even in the fiercest wind
Even the strongest wick grows dim and sick
When it's burning at both endsWalk your valley, walk your shadow
Afraid but on your feet
'Til your fire in my sky meetThere is nothing but now
Here's a cloth for your brow
You've done well
But it's time you rest awhileYou've taken on the whole world
Like a boy, like a girl
You're a full grown wonder
You're a childAll mis-believers
Speak with ease a cynic tongue
All is simple and loaded
Like buttons come undoneLike dreams and guns and questions
On fire but still alive
Unlock your best potential
[Incomprehensible] your sites on love tonightWalk your valley, walk your shadow
Afraid but on your feet
'Til your fire in the sky meetWalk your fire, walk your fire
Afraid but on your feet
'Til your fire in my sky meet 
When you set a match to your heart
Fueling it with bitterness and doubt
That's a blaze that once it starts
No amount of tears can put out
I know you're scared
But no one's spared
When you play with matches
You've got me walking through fire
You've got me walking through fireMaybe you've been burned by lovers
Maybe you've been scarred by the pain
But baby I'm not like the others
Drawing moths to a flame
Spite is like a spark
Crackling in the dark
Consuming all it catches
And you've got me walking through fire
You've got me walking through fire to get to you
You've got me walking through fire
(walking through fire)
You've got me walking through fire
(walking through fire)You can see the toll it's taking
You can feel the faith it's shaking
You can hear the heart it's breaking nowBaby I've burned by the fever
I've been scorched by desire
But baby I'm not your deceiver
Or your eloquent liar
Your jealous heart is tearing us apart
And turning love to ashes
When you've got me walking through fire
You've got me walking through fire to get to you
You've got me walking through fire
You've got me walking through fire
You've got me walking through fire
(walking through fire)
You've got me walking through fire
(walking through fire)
As the flames shoot higher
You've got me walking through fire
(walking through fire)
Walking 
War rugs in the hallway
Prayer rugs on the wall
Who's walkin' tall?
I should be kneelin'
[Bridge]
Soldier girl, oh, soldier boy
Tell me what to say
When I see you at Christmas leave
Tattooed and hazed
[Chorus]
Oh, we're all growin' up together
We're all makin' a mark on it
We're all damnin' the consequences
I want to understand
The soul you have in there
Young Egypt seized the moment
And brought that bastard down
You've got technology
And you've got archeology
We treated you like hunters
Until you kicked the goal
Now we're claimin' you for our team
'Cause what do we know?
Oh, we're all growin' up together
We're all watchin' the video
We're all damnin' the consequences
I want to understand
The soul you have in there
[Instrumental Interlude]
Soldier boy, oh, soldier girl
Tell me what to say
When I see you at Christmas leave
Oh, we're all growin' up together
We're all takin' it pass or fail
We're all damnin' the consequences
I want to understand
The soul it takes to stand
For something bigger than
Myself... 
The girl's known trouble
The wind's to blame
It blew her to any town USA
That's my middle nameAnd where we go
Remains nameless
A motion picture
Alive and framelssAnd we are together finally
And the dog caught up with
The rabbit is laughing hysterically
And we are together
You and meWe are together
TogetherShe's got that sadness
She twinkles like the witch
And you conjure a love spell
I'm gonna give a 5 year itchLow to the ground
High in the holler
(We are together)
In any old February
(Together)
Hot under the collar
(Collar)We are together finally
And the dog caught up with
The rabbit is laughing hysterically
And we are together
You and me yeah yeahThe setting sun at sadness beach
Just in view and out of reach
Resign myself to solitude
When love is hard to get and rudeAnd though I said I did not care
It was way before we'd gotten there
Winded by the fruitless chase
Until I saw you face to face
(Face to face)And we are together finally
And the dog caught up with
The rabbit is laughing hysterically
And we are together
You and me
The whole worldAnd we are together finally
(Finally, finally)
And the dog caught up with
The rabbit is laughing hysterically
And we are together
You and me 
My, my... how time flies.
First time I met you - had to shade my eyes.
Cuz staring into the sun can make a girl blind.
Now here we sit in a shady spot.
Got what I wanted, and I want what I got...
But through the will of my own,
I just found my way home.
Here is what I learned about you.
You set the sun and you hung the moon.
Mid October or the month of June,
Temperatures rise and fall,
We get to feel it all.
Sometimes I can't tell
You're open like a book or shut like a shell.
But if I hold you to my ear,
I can hear the whole world.
Dark stories of a distant past
Our time created in a single blast...
You like to laugh at me because I'm serious... serious
Yes it's true...
But, Here is what I learned about you.
You set the sun and you hung the moon.
Mid October or the month of June, temperatures rise and fall,
We get to feel it all. We get to feel it all. We get to feel it all.
We get to feel it all.
Time waits for no one...
So I'm remembering that day in the sun.
How I was thinking that you needed time to cool down.
Circumstances make us tired and colder...
That's my coat thrown around your shoulder
And I know you'll give it back to me if I need it...
I believe it...
Here is what I learned about you.
You set the sun and you hung the moon.
Mid October or the month of June, temperatures rise and fall...
Here is what I learned about you.
You set the sun and you hung the moon.
Mid October or the month of June, temperatures rise and fall,
We get to feel it all. 
Welcome me to the city of angels
Devil prophets still hold my hand
I walked your stillborn streets for hours
Ethnic echoes spitting out their trials
They tell me I'll, I'll be the first to praise the sun
The first to praise the moon
The first to hold the lone coyote
The last to set it freeWelcome me to a haven given
Oh, it's well received into my open arms
Oh, I, I ran in my sleep through shaking tremors
I had the splitting earth echoing in my ears
I feel that I'll, I'll be the first to praise the sun
The first to praise the moon
The first to hold the lone coyote
The last to set it freeWelcome me to your city of angels
See, there's a devil monkey laying on our backs
Now, tell me, where's the heart, where's the bullet for breaking
Who's gonna give me a weapon
A pacifying weapon
And I need to know, I'll be the first to praise the sun
The first to praise the moon
The first to hold the lone coyote
The last to set it free
Ha, I said I said, welcome me I'll be the first to praise the sun
The first to praise the moon
The first to hold the lone coyote
The last to set it free
I say welcome me 
Today my mind is drawing a blank
I canvas you to color this in
There's no gas left in the tank
You've always got your engines runningYou've got no whip but the beast lays down
And feeds upon the rest has finally foundWhat are you like?
My open door revolver
What are you like?
My go to problem solver
You shine a light in the darkest corners of my mind
What are you like? You're that kindI cover mirrors with the clocks (cover mirrors with the clocks)
I'm getting superstitious lately (you don't ever brush it off)
But you don't ever brush it off (you won't cover me to safety)
You won't cover me to safetyAnd while I'm sitting on this couch
You're up and figuring it outWhat are you like?
My open door revolver
What are you like?
My go to problem solver
You shine a light in the darkest corners of my mind
What are you like?The Greek chorus of our little play
You'll explain me when I act this way
And as we go along the unwritten song breaks through
And it's all about youWhat are you like? You're an open door
What are you like? You're the best and more
What are you like? You're a sacred text
What are you like? You're what's coming nextWhat are you like? You're my open door
What are you like? You're my open door
What are you like? You're my open door
What are you like? 
I should have never crossed your path
Funny how the things you want the most
Should soon be taken back
Slap my own hands like a child
Stealing from the candy store
I think I've taken to your smile
And I hunger for your laugh
Do the craziest things like look around
When I know you're nowhere near me
Break my back on a song
Though I know you're not there to hear it
Unanswered questions lying on the coffee table
From a song I haven't finished since last summer
Because I never could decide how much was gin
And how much the sea
Or other incidentals clouding what was really me
Everything I am is bare feet and burning sand
Waiting for the calm cool hand of the sea
A madman of emotions waiting for the drug effect
Of the reason and the intellect to comfort me
Half the time I love you like I love the fall's first breeze
And then you seem as distant to me as the skeletons of trees
Far away outside my window
But inside I think of you
As if I thouht hard enough I'd know which way to turn
And what to do.
I'm quite sure I'll be alright
We all live with some distraction
It's just too bad mine will hang around
All day and night
Like an uninvited guest
You can't turn away, try hard as you might
Lord knows, I've tried
I might let it go and take a long long run
Quit my job and join the coastline baking in the sun
(My tape cuts off here.) 
I wrote a letter to my senator
It came back "The Address Unknown"
Put a call in to the President
He wouldn't come to the phone
Now, how in the hell can a person
Feel safe and secure at home
When all the decisions are being made
By big boys getting stoned?
-Chorus-
Now, I've been listening and watching
It seems like something's going to give, yeah
I can't seem to find a groove
Something's gone wrong around here.
I took a train to the White House
Wrote this song on the way
Knocked at the Oval Office
I was sure what I had to say
They looked at me kinda funny
Asked me what group I was with
I said I've come on my own
To represent the group that don't take no shit
-Chorus-
(Caroline's 3rd verse)
Hey, Ronnie's taking time
We know that things ain't fine
Been sweating in your seat
*From the weapons scandal heat
You know that I love my country
But how can we get ahead?
Take your thumb out of my pie
Stick it somewhere else instead
(The girls' 3rd verse, c.1988)
Now, Jimmy Swaggart is taking time
We know that things ain't fine
Been sweating in your seat
*From the sex scandal heat
Think of that woman down in New Orleans
And what was in your head
Did you think you could save her soul
By getting into her bed?
-chorus x2- 
Childhood living
Is easy to do
The things you wanted
Well, I bought them for youAnd graceless lady
You know who I am
You know I can't let you
Ah, slide through my handsWild horses
Couldn't drag me away
Wild, wild horses
Couldn't drag me awayI watched you suffer
A dull aching pain
Now you've decided
To show me the sameNo sweeping exits
Or offstage lines
Can make me feel bitter
Or treat you unkindWild horses
Couldn't drag me away
Wild, wild horses
Couldn't drag me awayI know I dreamed you
A sin and a lie
I have my freedom
But I don't have much timeFaith has been broken
Tears must be cried
Come on let's do some living
After we dieWild horses
Couldn't drag me away
Wild, wild horses
We'll ride them someday 
Out in the back by the grape stake fence
Is a place where nature makes so much sense
All the creatures livin' in harmony
It's a wild wild party in the loquat treeFuzzies and furries run walk or fly
Havin' a feast beneath a clear blue sky
Animals comin' from miles around
To bounce the branch and shake the loquat downThe squirrel and the sparrow and the mouse and the bee
All havin' a party in the loquat tree
Eatin' all the yellow fruit they can see
It's a wild wild party in the loquat treePeckin' at 'em pickin' at 'em hidin' 'em away
Savin' 'em up for a rainy day
No matter how big no matter how small
There's more than enough there's plenty for allThe squirrel and the sparrow and the mouse and the bee
All havin' a party in the loquat tree
Eatin' all the yellow fruit they can see
It's a wild wild party in the loquat treeChatter chirp squeak buzz
Chatter chirp squeak buzz
Chatter chirp squeak buzz
Chatter chirp squeak buzzEvery little loquat holds the seed
For a brand-new baby loquat tree
One o' these seeds may find it's way
To a place in the sun and then somedayThe squirrel and the sparrow and the mouse and the bee
All havin' a party in the loquat tree
Eatin' all the yellow fruit they can see
It's a wild wild party in the loquat treeThe squirrel and the sparrow and the mouse and the bee
All havin' a party in the loquat tree
Eatin' all the yellow fruit they can see
(eatin' all the yellow fruit)
It's a wild wild party in the loquat tree
(eatin' all the yellow fruit)The squirrel and the sparrow and the mouse and the bee
(eatin' all the yellow fruit)
[havin' a party]
All havin' a party in the loquat tree
(eatin' all the yellow fruit)
[in the loquat tree]
Eatin' all the yellow fruit they can see
(eatin' all the yellow fruit)

It's a wild wild party in the loquat tree 
When we get back to Winthrop
Few miles from the airport
On a plastic chair
On a deck where my friends liveI watch the takin' off airplanes
I watch the ocean waves crashing
I knew with all of this movement
Something's got to giveDown at the high tide
Passed down through the family
The fishermen gather
To complain about the catchThen they talk about time
Then they talk about tides
The pull of the moon
And the coffee deep night blackAnd I listen to them
And I listen to you
And for someone there is something
Never coming backBut for all that we've been through
For all that we've promised
Your wayward direction seems insensibleWords fall off like breathless fish
All flopping and scattered
And hearts picked over deemed dispensableDown at the high tide
And were there for our last meal
The broken loaves are still enough for allWhen we talk about time
We talk about tides
Under the moon
With the deep night coffee blackI hear the dim roar
Of the last flight out
And for someone there is someone
Never coming backTalk about time
We talk about tides
Under the moon
With the deep night coffee blackSo when I hear the dim roar
Of the last flight out
And for someone there is someone
Never coming back 
So
So you think you can tell
Heaven from hell
Blue skys from grey
Can you tell a green field
From a cold steel rail
A smile from a veil
Yeah do you think you can tellDid they get you to trade
Your heros for ghosts
Hot ashes for trees
Hot air for a cool breeze
Cold comfort for change
Yeah and did you exchange
A walk on part in this war
For a leading role in a cageHow I wish, how I wish you were here
We're just two lost souls
Swimming in a fish bowl
Year after year
We're running over the same old ground
What have we found
The same old fears
Well I wish you were here
I said I wish you were here yeah
Oh how I wish you were here
How I wish you were here
Hey and I wish you were here
Hey my rock star
How did you get so turned around
My rock star
How you did you get so turned around
Oh my rock star
(how did you get so turned around)
Did you get so turned around
Hey my my rock star
(how did you get so turned around
Inside out
Cut it all out now
Cut it all out now
Cut it all out now
Cut it all out now
Cut it out now
Cut it out now
Cut it out now
Cut it out now
Cut it all out now
Cut it all out now
Cut it all out 
I'm comin' home with a stone
Strapped onto my back
I'm comin' home with a burnin' hope
Turnin' all my blues to black
I'm lookin' for a sacred hand
To carve into my stone
A ghost of comfort, Angel's breath
To keep this life inside my chestThis world falls on me
Hopes of immortality
Everywhere I turn
All the beauty just keeps shakin' meNow I woke up in the middle of a dream
Scared the world was too much for me
Sejarez said, "Don't let go
Just plant the seeds and watch them grow"
I've slept in rainy canyon lands
Cold drenched to my skin
I always wake to find a face
To calm these troubled landsAh this world falls on me
With dreams of immortality
Everywhere I turn
All the beauty just keeps shakin' meNow I'm runnin'
To the end of the earth
And I'm swimmin'
To the edge of the sea
And I'm laughin'
I'm under a starry sky
This poor world is meant for me
Don't bury me, carry meI wish I was a nomad
An Indian or a saint
The edge of death would disappear
Leave me nothin' left to taint
I wish I was a nomad
An Indian or a saint
Give me walkin' shoes, feathered arms
And a key to Heaven's gateAh this world falls on me
Dreams of immortality
Everywhere I turn
All the beauty just keeps shakin' meI'm runnin'
(This world falls on me)
To the end of the earth
(With hopes of immortality)
I'm swimmin'
(Everywhere I turn)
To the edge of the sea
(The beauty keeps on shaking me)
And I'm laughin'
(This world falls on me)
'Cause I'm under a starry sky
(Hopes of immortality)
This world was meant for me
(Everywhere I turn)
I've got hopes of immortality 
Wysteria
Did you change your face again
Those of us who loved you when
Can't even find youWysteria
Did you lose another man
Did you make him understand
That he can't touch youWysteria
Did he take you to the fair
Were the folks that you met there
The same that we metWysteria
Did he teach you how to dance
Did he bring you paper fans
To hide your secretsWas he just like all the rest
When he got to the sad part
Did he stay a bit too long
To save his heartWas he just like all the rest
When he got to the sad part
Did he stay a bit too long
To save his heartWysteria
Are your lips still lily white
Do they still bloom just at night
And die at sunrise
